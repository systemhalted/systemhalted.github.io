I"ã<p>On 13th March 2017, we welcomed our princess, Rinayra. Rinayra means princess. The spelling should have been Rinaira. But <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> was looking odd. So, we replaced it with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>. No numerology. Mom and baby are doing fine.</p>

<p>One important thing to note. I was born on 13th August. So, Rinayra shares my birth date. Rayirth was born in August 2013 and he shares the month with me. I cannot be happier.</p>
