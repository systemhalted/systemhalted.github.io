I"<p>I am not perfect. I have made mistakes and understand that many people might not have. I try fixing one and make another. I don’t know if there will be a time when I won’t make any mistakes.</p>

<p>For now, I am changing my personal daily log to include 4 things:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>A thing or two I am grateful about</li>
  <li>A thing of two I feel I did great</li>
  <li>A thing or two I think I did ok but could have done better</li>
  <li>A thing that needs total refinement, which as of now is a blind spot for me and an action plan</li>
</ul>

<p>I will do a monthly review of the progress I am making in the matters requiring attention - maybe will maintain a scorecard of sorts.</p>

<p>This post is just to remind me in case I forget. Though I am also creating a calendar entry.</p>
