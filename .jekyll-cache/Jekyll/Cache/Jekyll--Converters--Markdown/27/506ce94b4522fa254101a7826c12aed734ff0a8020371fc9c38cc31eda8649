I" <p>I like Unit Tests and am a huge fan of those (another post on that later). On the other hand TDD not so much. TDD or Test Driven Development is my nightmare. I canâ€™t do it. Mostly, I struggle with it. Always, in the end, I hate it.</p>

<p>I get it why it is important to follow TDD. Vladimir Sedach mentioned in his blog<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, â€œForcing unit tests to be written before the code ensures that unit tests are actually written.â€ He rightly says that it is a Taylorist Management Technique for â€œreducing software maintenance cost.â€
What it means is that Unit Tests are an effective way to reduce software maintenance costs and TDD just enforces that unit tests are actually written. In itself TDD doesnâ€™t guarantee software with less bugs. It is a Management technique not a Technology.</p>
