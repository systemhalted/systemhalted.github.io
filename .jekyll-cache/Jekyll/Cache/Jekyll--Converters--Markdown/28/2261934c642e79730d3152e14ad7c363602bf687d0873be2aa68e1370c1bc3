I"I<p>Testing is important. Testing software is important. But testing can not guarantee a perfect product. It can provide information that can be used to mitigate risk of releasing a product.</p>

<p>Also, for a perfect product, you need perfect and exhaustive testing and as Gerald M. Weinberg<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> said in his book Perfect Software<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, this will require an infinite number of tests, which will require more time than the life of a product itself.</p>

<p>Edsger W. Dijkstra<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> said, “Testing may convincingly demonstrate the presence of bugs, but can never demonstrate their absence.” So, use tests to gain the information about bugs in your program/product. And fix them. Do not let the presence of bugs shame you if your testing caught them. You will not have a perfect product but you are at least mitigating the risk to not have a low quality one.</p>
