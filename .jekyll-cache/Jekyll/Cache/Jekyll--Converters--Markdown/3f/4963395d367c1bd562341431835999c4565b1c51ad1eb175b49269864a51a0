I"ä<p>In my last post, I told you that I recently bought a used ThinkPad T430 from ebay. The first thing I noticed was that the battery drains within no time and I need to keep the laptop plugged in, which in turn means there is only little mobility that it affords me. So, I wanted to check how much battery life is remaining. Windows 10 comes with a great power tool to generate battery report. To generate this report, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a Powershell with elevated (admin) access.</li>
  <li>Run the following command:</li>
</ol>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span class="nf">powercfg</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">/batteryreport</span></code></pre></figure>

<ol>
  <li>This will generate the report<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> in the current folder with a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">battery-report.html</code>. Open this file in a browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:fn1">
      <p>At the bottom of the report you will see the section <code class="highlighter-rouge">Current estimate of battery life based on all observed drains since OS install</code>. This will have two columns, <code class="highlighter-rouge">At Full Charge</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">At Design Capacity</code>. These will be the time the battery will retain juice at full charge compared to what it was designed for respectively.
