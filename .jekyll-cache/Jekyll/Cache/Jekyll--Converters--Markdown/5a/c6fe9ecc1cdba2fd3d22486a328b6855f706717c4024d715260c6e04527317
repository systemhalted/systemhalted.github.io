I"j<p>Second course and thus the second semester in #gatech #omscs over. It is a great experience however challenging it might be. Challenge comes from multiple vectors - course rubric, family, work and personal aspirations. It is good to overcome all these challenges semester after semester. I hope am able to finish all 10 courses required and donâ€™t drop.</p>
