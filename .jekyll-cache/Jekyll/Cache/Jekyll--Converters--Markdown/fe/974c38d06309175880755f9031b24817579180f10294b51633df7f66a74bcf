I"Œ<p>Today, I sold my car. Not to a dealer but Carvana<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I had leased a car in 2018 - Toyota Camry SE. Recently, during my conversation with my friend, Gurjinder, he shared his nice experience with Carvana. So, I decided to give it a try. I got an offer instantaneously and within one day I was able to schedule a pick up.</p>

<p>The pick up happened today. The Carvana agent came and within 10 min, we were done with all the formalities and I got the payment electronically.</p>

<p>The experience was what we all are striving to provide our customers - painless and hassle-free. Carvana has surely nailed it.</p>
