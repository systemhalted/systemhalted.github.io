description: Loved few of the talks by Richard Feldman on Roc-lang in particular and language design in general
---

Recently,  I listened to the talk "Outperforming Imperative with Pure Functional Languages"[^1] by Richard Feldman [^2]. I loved the talk. I have listened to several talks on new languages and language design but this talk stands out because it was not a talk that bashed other languages but articulated the need for a new language (albeit briefly) and how functional programs can be made to be performant in comparison to the imperative languages like Java, C++, etc. 

This is really a great talk. The talk covered three main performance considersations:  
1. Language Overhead 
2. No side effects
3. No mutation.
