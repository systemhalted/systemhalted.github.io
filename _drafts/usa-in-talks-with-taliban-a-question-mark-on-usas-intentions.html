<p style="text-align:justify;">It is difficult to understand what exactly the USA is doing in Afghanistan. Though for past one decade of their “occupation” of Afghanistan they have maintained that they are fighting against <a class="zem_slink" title="Terrorism" href="http://www.history.com/topics/terrorism" rel="historycom">international terrorism</a>, the recent activities and Afghanistan’s President <a class="zem_slink" title="Hamid Karzai" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai" rel="wikipedia">Hamid Karzai</a>’s disclosure that America is in talks with Taliban comes as a shocking surprise. It may also be devastating for the war-torn country in particular and the entire world in general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><!--more-->United States had targeted Afghanistan (Taliban) after 9/11 attack on <a class="zem_slink" title="World Trade Center" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center" rel="wikipedia">World Trade Centre</a> which had a major presence in the skyline ofNew York City. Since then USA and its allies have occupied Afghanistan and have repeated myriad times that it is their fight against terrorism. The recent talks of American delegation with associates of Taliban’s chief <a class="zem_slink" title="Mohammed Omar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Omar" rel="wikipedia">Mullah Omar</a> puts a question mark on the whole process and intention of <a class="zem_slink" title="The States" href="http://www.history.com/topics/states" rel="historycom">USA</a> to occupy <a class="zem_slink" title="Afghanistan" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=34.5166666667,69.1333333333&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=34.5166666667,69.1333333333 (Afghanistan)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation">Afghanistan</a> a decade ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">USA intends to remove its armies from the soil of Afghanistan by 2014 and that process has to start within a month or so. Thus, USA seems to be in a hurry to resolve the issue of Afghanistan and if it means to shake hands with Taliban, then let it be. It seems that USA is ready to “forgive” Taliban if the latter is ready to help in the re-development of Afghanistan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole question is now that why is USA talking with Taliban, which is a terrorist organisation, and against which USA had started a war. If Taliban is involved in the redevelopment process then what is the guarantee that it will not lead Afghanistan to pre-2001. There is no guarantee but every possibility that this will happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Indian perspective, it will be a major setback to her efforts to bring Afghanistan on the track of development. Moreover, it will be of immense help to Pakistan and specially its <a class="zem_slink" title="Inter-Services Intelligence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence" rel="wikipedia">Inter-Services Intelligence</a> and a huge impediment to the fight against terrorism in South Asia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an irony that USA is ready to place the ropes of government in the hands of the same organisation against which it has pledged a decade ago and attacked Afghanistan to cleanse the terrorism pot. Where is the morality and what is their strategy?</p>
