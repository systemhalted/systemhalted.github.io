<p><span style="font-family:arial;">It is now little more than a month after Nanaji left us to his abode at God's place. The only thing that remain with us are his memories. We have a good memory, but whatever else we remember or forget, his memories will never die or forgotten. </span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-family:arial;">I last talked with him overe phone in June when I was in Mysore. He was breathing heavily as he was not well. It was difficult to listen and understand what he was saying. He had fallen a few days before and had hurt himself. The only thing that I regret is that I was not present during his cremation. </span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;">Nanaji was very smart and looking him one could easily say that he would have been even more smarter and handsome during his days. I dont know what feelings I have for him but one thing is sure that I liked him a lot. </span>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">I don't want to write anything about him. Simply he was great!!</span></p>
