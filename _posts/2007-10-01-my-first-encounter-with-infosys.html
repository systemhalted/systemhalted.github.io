<p>I don't know why I started writing this. However, I know that it was somewhere in my mind to write something on it. I had lost hope to get a call from Infosys. So, I was trying to run for a job somewhere, anywhere. </p>
<p>On 5th March 2006 (Sunday), I took an exam of a company that charges Rs.1200/- and shared its former name with a bank. But I never wanted to join that company. Next Sunday, ie, 12th March 2006, I had to go to Hyderabad to attend the written test of the company that is said to have given IPODs to its employee on account of its 25 years celebration. But on 9th March, I saw an advertisement in TOI ACCENT about INFOSYS Walk-in at Gyan Vihar Universe, Jaipur. So, a hope came to my satisfaction. I dropped the idea of going to Hyderabad and the very next day left for Jaipur. I took written test on 11th March 2006. At 5:30 PM, the results were declared and 43 were called next day for the interview. Next day, I attended interview at 10:45 AM, 25 minuted late of the scheduled time. My interview was okay, but they didn't asked a single puzzle. I thought that they are not going to select me as each and every person was being asked a puzzle or two. Anyways, I returned to my mausi's house at Lal-Kothi. In the evening we went to Clarks Amer to attend a 'Kavi Sammelan' on account of Holi. </p>
<p>On 13th March, I  returned to Agra. On 16th March, my friend called me asking about my Infosys result. But I had no idea. Then I went to cyber cafe and tok names of all the GODs that I could remember and opened my gmail account. And to my astonishment I had a mail from Infy regarding my selection. </p>
<p>I was so overwhelmed that I could not speak for five minutes. </p>
<p>After that result all the results came flowing in and I got selected in almost every company of which I had taken the tests.</p>
<p>I just thank Mehndipur Balaji for his blessings.</p>
