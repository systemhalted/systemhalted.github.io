<p><span style="font-family:verdana;color:#000099;">Read <a href="http://rashtraman.blogspot.com/2008/03/is-raj-thakarey-right.html">an article on Shailendra's blog.</a> I agree with whatever he has said. The issue is widespread and is deep rooted in the way Indian Politics works. The lack of visibility, innovation and above all the determination needed to address such issues or prevent them from happening lacks among politicians and also the Indian populace. The politicians use these issues in their favour and people either blindly follow or oppose them. The issue needs to be addressed as early as possible and genuinely with eagerness to perform or compute a solution. And we should understand that migration is not the solution. The solution lies in development and progress of underdeveloped states. </span></p>
