<p><span style="font-family:verdana;">We need leaders. Not exactly leaders but mass leaders who can help masses find a direction, who can help them to "act" instead of just giving verbal expression. A leader like Mahatma Gandhi. I have an untramelled desire to be a part of movement that will lead to the benefit of the masses but fear amounts higher.</span></p>
