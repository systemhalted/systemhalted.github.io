<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">Reservation is for the upliftment of the depressed and continuing it for the lifetime of the nation is not good. People for whom this is meant should recognise the efforts the government is putting in for their upliftment and use this opportunity to bring themselves to the mainstream of Indian society. They should understand that Reservation is not a good thing to happen for the society as it is an indication of social inequality and social injustice which do exist in our social setup. We need to diminish this and bring to our country, our nation a society that is free from inequality, injustice and any form of Reservation; but to make this happen people who fall in the category to be benefited from Reservation should come forward and utilize this opportunity to rise and help themselves and the society as a whole to acquire a socially forward, equal and just status.</span></p>
