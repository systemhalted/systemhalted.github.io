<p>I am skeptical about what OSHO said. Sometimes I think that what he preached was near to life. We think that a Mahatma is a person who leaves all the materialistic luxuries of life and do dhyaan. But to me all the common men who handle and deal with the day to day problems of their monotonous life are Mahatma. It is easy to leave the worldly pleasures and sorrows than to face them firmly.</p>
