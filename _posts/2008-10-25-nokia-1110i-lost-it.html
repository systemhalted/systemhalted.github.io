<p>The song that is coming in my mind is from film Rock On, "Pichhle Saat Dino Mein Maine Khoya." Yes it is true for me, but not in seven days but last three months. Recent addition is my Nokia 1110i - my lucky charm. I broke it two weeks ago. I am sorry for it!!</p>
<p><!--more-->I bought it on 14th March 2006 and after two days I got offer letter from Infosys. That is why I call it my lucky charm because Infosys has always been a dream company. I linked this news with my buying my new phone Nokia 1110i.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful mobile. The most important thing for me was to be in contact with everyone I know. For that I need to talk and that a lot. So I needed a mobile with long battery power. And in this respect it was awesome. For weeks I never used to charge my mobile but it never gave up hope.</p>
<p>I broke it in frustration and I am sorry for my act. But it is gone giving way for a new phone.</p>
