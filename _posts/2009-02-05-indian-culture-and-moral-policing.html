<p><span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;"><span style="font-size:x-small;">Who is going to define morality? What is right and what is wrong? These are very subjective and open questions and depend upon the perception of a person. Why should I hear someone else opinion and his lessons on morality? Here we are talking about "Indian Culture". How is someone going to define Indian Culture and its boundary conditions? This again is very subjective. We all know our past but as told, taught and read. But is that the whole thing – the complete Indian Culture. No, definitely not. Because one who told and taught us might have forgotten something, and one who wrote something must have not written completely or thoroughly. So, our knowledge is more or less the same, but we have different opinions on Indian Culture depending on what has been told and taught and what and whom we have read. So, no one is  the authority on Indian Culture rather culture, in general. We can have our own beliefs, thoughts and perception. So, no one can say that his belief is right and others is wrong and impose it on others.</span></span></span></span></p>
