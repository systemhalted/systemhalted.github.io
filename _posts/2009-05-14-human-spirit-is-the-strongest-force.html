<p>I read this quote byÂ Dr. <a class="zem_slink" title="Daisaku Ikeda" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisaku_Ikeda" rel="wikipedia">Daisaku Ikeda</a> and liked it. I do not claim that I follow this but would love to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>The human spirit is the strongest force there is. As long as our spirit remains unbroken, there is no defeat. In life, spiritual defeat always precedes actual defeat. Guard against laziness, cowardice, carelessness, impatience, resignation and despair which corrode the human spirit and sow the seeds of defeat.</p></blockquote>
<p>As long as you stay in your high spirits, there is nothing in life which can defeat you. We defeat not by the circumstances but by the way we take them, by our own actions and response to the situations.</p>
