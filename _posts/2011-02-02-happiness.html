<p>I was going through Bruno's One Minute Email  that I subscribed while I was working for VCustomer. It was after a long  time that I checked my email account on<a href="http://www.india.com"> india.com</a>, where we all  registered as it was the only email account accessible there. Oh, sorry,  I forgot my way.<!--more--></p>
<p>One of the recent emails has this old Chinese Proverb:-</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want hapiness for an hour, take a nap;<br />
If you want hapiness for a day, go fishing;<br />
If you want hapiness for a year, inherit a fortune;<br />
If you want hapiness for a lifetime, help somebody!</p></blockquote>
<p>"Helping" is a word that needs interpretation. Giving money to a good  cause is one way but it's not the only one. Sometimes helping simply  means taking the time to listen to someone sharing a hurt, giving  someone a helping hand, making an unexpected phone call to wish someone  good luck, showing compassion to someone in trouble.</p>
<blockquote><p>I discovered a long time ago that if I helped people get what they wanted,<br />
I would always get what I wanted and I would never have to worry.<br />
- Anthony Robbins</p></blockquote>
<p>There is more to hapiness. Just waiting for it and thinking when such  and such thing happen I will be happy is foolish. Yes, I am a fool. I  am still waiting for something to happen that will make me happy.</p>
<p>Are you a fool too???   Don't be!!!!</p>
