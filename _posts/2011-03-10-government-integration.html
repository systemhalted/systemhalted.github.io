<p>From all the government literature that I have read in last few years, I have found that usage of phrases and terms like Integrated Action Plan, Sustainability with Inclusive growth and whatsoever are the right ingredients for policy formulation. Without these terms and phrases, the regulations or policies will not have any appeal. And for votes you need appeal!! Who the hell cares about results!! Right????</p>
<p>We are big on words, small when it comes to action!!!</p>
