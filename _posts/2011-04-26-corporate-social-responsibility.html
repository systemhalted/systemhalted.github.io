<ul>
<li><strong>Official definition of CSR</strong>
<ul>
<li>The World Business Council defines CSR (<a class="zem_slink" title="Corporate social responsibility" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility" rel="wikipedia">Corporate Social Responsibility</a>) as “the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to <a class="zem_slink" title="Economic development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development" rel="wikipedia">economic development</a> while improving the <a class="zem_slink" title="Quality of life" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life" rel="wikipedia">quality of life</a> of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large”.</li>
<li>Accordingly, corporate responsibility involves a commitment by a company to “manage its role in society as a producer, employer, marketer, customer and a citizen in a responsible and suitable manner”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government moves on making CSR mandatory</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Companies Bill 2009, which is likely to be tabled in the forthcoming budget session, has proposed that companies will have to earmark 2% of their average net profits during the preceding three years for corporate social responsibility spending or disclose to their shareholders if they fail to do so.</li>
<li>The government had earlier taken a similar stance before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance. It had told the panel that it could ask companies having a minimum <a class="zem_slink" title="Net worth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth" rel="wikipedia">net worth</a> of Rs 500 crore, or an annual turnover of Rs 1,000 crore, or a <a class="zem_slink" title="Net profit" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_profit" rel="wikipedia">net profit</a> of Rs 5 crore in a year to spend at least 2% of their average net profit during the three preceding <a class="zem_slink" title="Fiscal year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year" rel="wikipedia">fiscal years</a> on CSR. However, later the ministry diluted the proposal following intense lobbying from the industry.</li>
<li>In an earlier presentation to the government, the <a class="zem_slink" title="Confederation of Indian Industry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_Indian_Industry" rel="wikipedia">Confederation of Indian Industry</a> had demanded that the new law should not specify an amount to be spent on CSR, and that a decision on the actual spend be left to company boards. The industry body had suggested that CSR should be voluntary and backed by a system of state recognition and honour.</li>
<li>To check non-compliance, the parliamentary committee had recommended separate disclosures by companies in their annual reports through a CSR statement indicating the company policy as well as specific steps taken.</li>
