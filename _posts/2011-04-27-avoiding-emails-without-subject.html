<p>More often than not I used to compile a fantastic mail to send to my colleagues (even managers) in office and just after clicking "Send" button, it used to strike me that I have missed mentioning the subject. So, I requested few friends on <a class="zem_slink" title="Infosys Technologies" href="http://www.infosys.com/" rel="homepage">Infosys</a> internal blogs to send me the script for Outlook. And Nikhil Kurien mailed me the requested piece of code. It was back in 2007. I was just cleaning up my mails and thought it would be better if I keep it on my blog as it would make it easy for me to access it whenever I wish rather than searching for the mail. So, here are the steps that we need to follow:-</p>
<p>1. Open your outlook</p>
<p>2. Press Alt+F11 (this opens the <a class="zem_slink" title="Visual Basic" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/default.aspx" rel="homepage">Visual Basic</a> editor)</p>
<p>3. On the Left Pane you'll see "<a class="zem_slink" title="Microsoft Outlook" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/outlook" rel="homepage">Microsoft Outlook</a> Objects", expand this. Now one can see the "ThisOutLookSession".</p>
<p>4. Click on "ThisOutLookSession".</p>
<p>5. Copy and Paste the following code in the right pane. (Code Pane)</p>
<p><code>Private Sub Application_ItemSend(ByVal Item As Object, Cancel As Boolean)</p>
<p>Dim strSubject As String</p>
<p>strSubject = Item.Subject</p>
<p>If Len(strSubject) = 0 Then</p>
<p>Prompt$ = "Subject is Empty. Are you sure you want to send the Mail?"</p>
<p>If MsgBox(Prompt$, vbYesNo + vbQuestion + vbMsgBoxSetForeground, "Check for Subject") = vbNo Then</p>
<p>Cancel = True</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>End Sub</code></p>
<p>6. Save this and now close the VB Code editor and take a breath. From now on, this macro will make sure you do not make the mistake of sending an email without subject.</p>
