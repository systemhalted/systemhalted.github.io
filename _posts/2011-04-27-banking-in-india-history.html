<ul>
<li><a class="zem_slink" title="Banking in India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_India" rel="wikipedia">Banking in India</a> started with setting up of two banks in the last decades of the 18th century. The banks were:-        1.  The General <a class="zem_slink" title="Bank of India" href="http://www.bankofindia.com/" rel="homepage">Bank of India</a>  (1786)    2.  Bank of Hindustan (1790)    <strong>Both of them are now defunct. </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then came <a class="zem_slink" title="Bank of Calcutta" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Calcutta" rel="wikipedia">Bank of Calcutta</a> (June, 1806) which finally became <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=State+Bank+of+India">State Bank of India</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Indian merchants in <a class="zem_slink" title="Kolkata" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata" rel="wikipedia">Calcutta</a> established the Union Bank in 1839, but it failed in 1848 as a consequence of the economic crisis of 1848-49.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="zem_slink" title="Allahabad Bank" href="http://www.allahabadbank.in" rel="homepage">Allahabad Bank</a>, established in 1865 and still functioning today, is the <strong>oldest Joint Stock bank still functioning in India.</strong> The first one was <strong>Bank of Upper India</strong>, which was established in 1863, and which survived until 1913, when it failed, with some of its assets and liabilities being transferred to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Alliance Bank of Simla" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Bank_of_Simla" rel="wikipedia">Alliance Bank of Simla</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foreign banks too started to arrive, particularly in Calcutta, in the 1860s. The <strong>Comptoire d'Escompte de Paris</strong> opened a branch in Calcutta in 1860, and another in Bombay in 1862; branches in Madras and Puducherry, then a French colony, followed. <strong>HSBC </strong>established itself in Bengal in 1869. Calcutta was the most active trading port in India, mainly due to the trade of the British Empire, and so became a banking center.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first entirely Indian joint stock bank was the <strong>Oudh Commercial Bank</strong>, established in 1881 in Faizabad. It failed in 1958.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next was the <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Punjab National Bank" href="http://www.pnbindia.com/" rel="homepage">Punjab National Bank</a></strong>, established in <strong>Lahore </strong>in <strong>1895</strong>, which has survived to the present and is now one of the largest banks in India.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The period between <strong>1906 and 1911</strong>, saw the establishment of banks inspired by the <strong>Swadeshi </strong>movement. The Swadeshi movement inspired local businessmen and political figures to found banks of and for the Indian community. A number of banks established then have survived to the present such as <strong>Bank of India, <a class="zem_slink" title="Corporation Bank" href="http://www.corpbank.com/" rel="homepage">Corporation Bank</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Indian Bank" href="http://www.indianbank.in/" rel="homepage">Indian Bank</a>, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Central Bank of India</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The fervour of Swadeshi movement lead to establishing of many private banks in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi district which were unified earlier and known by the name <strong>South Canara</strong> ( South Kanara ) district. Four nationalised banks started in this district and also a leading private sector bank. Hence undivided <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Dakshina Kannada district" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshina_Kannada_district" rel="wikipedia">Dakshina Kannada district</a></strong> is known as "<strong>Cradle of Indian Banking</strong>".</li>
