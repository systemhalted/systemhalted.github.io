<p><strong>Note</strong>:<em> I am starting with a series on <a class="zem_slink" title="Banking in India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_India" rel="wikipedia">Banking in India</a>. Will try to include everything regarding Indian Banking System that is necessary from examinations point of view. To start with here is the Story of <a class="zem_slink" title="State Bank of India" href="http://www.statebankofindia.com/" rel="homepage">State Bank of India</a>. I selected SBI because I have a special place for SBI in my life. It has a part in shaping my life. How? It is the bank where my father, two of my uncles (tauji and chacha) and above all my grandfather (babaji) served. </em></p>
<p>The oldest bank <strong>in existence</strong> in India is the State Bank of India, which originated in the <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Bank of Calcutta" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Calcutta" rel="wikipedia">Bank of Calcutta</a></strong> in June 1806, which almost immediately became the <strong>Bank of Bengal</strong>. This was one of the three presidency banks, the other two being the <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Bank of Bombay" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Bombay" rel="wikipedia">Bank of Bombay</a></strong> and the <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Bank of Madras" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Madras" rel="wikipedia">Bank of Madras</a></strong>, all three of which were established under charters from the <a class="zem_slink" title="East India Company" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company" rel="wikipedia">British East India Company</a>. For many years the Presidency banks acted as quasi-central banks, as did their successors. The three banks merged in<strong>1921 </strong>to form the <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Imperial Bank of India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Bank_of_India" rel="wikipedia">Imperial Bank of India</a></strong>, which, upon India's independence, became the <strong>State Bank of India</strong>.</p>
