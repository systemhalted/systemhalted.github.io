<p><strong>What is Credit Crunch?</strong></p>
<p>In simple words, when you can't get loans easily, its <a class="zem_slink" title="Credit crunch" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_crunch" rel="wikipedia">credit crunch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Reduction in the general availability of loans (or credit) or a sudden tightening of the conditions required to obtain a loan from the banks. </em></p>
<p><strong>Examples of credit crunch</strong></p>
<p>1. In America, banks were giving housing loans to any swinging dude, without checking his <a class="zem_slink" title="Credit risk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk" rel="wikipedia">credit-worthiness</a> (like can he really pay back the loan or not?). This lead to mass-defaults after few years. Now bank managers are very cautious and before processing your loan application, they'll check it 17 times! this is also a sort of credit crunch because you can't get loans that easily, like you used to get, before the recession.</p>
<p>2. In 3G auction spectrum, telecom companies took 70,000 cr. from <a class="zem_slink" title="Banking in India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_India" rel="wikipedia">Indian Banks</a> to bid in the auction. = lot of money flew out of the system. So for a time being, banks have less money to give as loans to other customers = Credit crunch. (although that didnot happen) but suppose <a class="zem_slink" title="Mukesh Ambani" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani" rel="wikipedia">Mukesh Ambani</a> had called up a bank asking for 50000 cr. loan for acquiring a foreign company next morning, Bank manager might have said 'Sir, sorry we don't have no money!"</p>
<p><strong>Implications of Credit Crunch</strong></p>
<p>Credit crunch is not good for economy, because</p>
<ol>
<li>A businessman wants to start new factory, but cannot get loans easily = slowdown in economy.</li>
<li>A couple wants to buy home, but can't get home-loan easily = slowdown in real-estate sector.</li>
<li>A college kids wants a new bike, but his dad can't get loan easily = slowdown in automobile sector, <em>but also good from climate-change angle. as people will be forced to use public transport system ;-)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>If such credit crunch continues for a long time, it'll lead to job-losses, factories shutting down and finally recession.</p>
<p>But sometimes credit crunch is a<strong> necessary evil</strong>, when there is too much liquidity (money) in the market.</p>
<p>Too much liquidity = too much money = easy to get loans = people have more money in their hands compared to the items available for purchase = hyper-inflation.</p>
<p>From the previous post about CRR &amp; <a class="zem_slink" title="Statutory Liquidity Ratio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_Liquidity_Ratio" rel="wikipedia">SLR</a>, we can also say that an (Excessive) increase in CRR and SLR will lead to Credit crunch.</p>
