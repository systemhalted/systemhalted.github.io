<p>You gave me 100 Rs and I gave you a paper writing" I'll pay back 120 Rs. after 1 year"</p>
<p>This paper is <strong>bond.</strong></p>
<p>You give me 100 Rs. and I gave you a paper "this gives you a partnership of 100 Rs. in my company, I'll share profit with you accordingly."</p>
<p>This is <strong>equity /share</strong>. Here the you get a share in the profit only if my company makes profit.</p>
<p>But if you give me 100 Rs. and I gave you a paper writing "I'm gonna pay Rs.15 per year no matter how much profit or loss I make in my company"</p>
<p>This is <strong>debenture.</strong></p>
