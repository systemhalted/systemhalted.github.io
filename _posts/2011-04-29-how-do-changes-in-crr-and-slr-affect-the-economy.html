<p><strong>First lets see what exactly is CRR and SLR:-</strong></p>
<p><strong>CRR - <a class="zem_slink" title="Reserve requirement" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement" rel="wikipedia">Cash Reserve Ratio</a></strong>:- You're a banker, you've to keep deposit that much ca$h in RBI.</p>
<p><strong>SLR - <a class="zem_slink" title="Statutory Liquidity Ratio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_Liquidity_Ratio" rel="wikipedia">Statutory Liquidity Ratio</a>:- </strong>You've to keep that much gold/ca$h/bonds in your bank.</p>
<p>Lets assume you're a banker, have 100 Rs. cr.</p>
<p>Out of that you were required to keep aside 1 cr. worth cash, gold etc. in SLR+CRR in Jan'11 as per RBI order.</p>
<p>So you've 99 cr. to give as loan and earn interest out of it.</p>
<p>But in Feb'11,  RBI increases both ratios, so you've to keep aside 15 cr. in SLR+CRR.</p>
<p>So you only have 85 cr. to give as loan and earn interest out of it. Obviously you'll charge more interest, when giving loans, to maintain same amount of profit.</p>
<p><strong>How does this affect economy?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Well Lower SLR+CRR, means bank can give more money as loan = lower interest rates = cheap loan = more people take loan to start business or building house or buying car = boost in economy</li>
<li>HOWEVER, <strong>can also lead to inflation</strong>, if people have more cash in their hands than the items available for purchase in the market.</li>
<li>Higher SLR+CRR = bank can give less money as loan = HIGHER interest rate = it becomes expensive to start a new factory, buy a new house / car/bike. This can curb inflation but may also lead to <strong>slowdown in economy,</strong>because people wait for the interest rates to go down, before taking loans.</li>
</ol>
