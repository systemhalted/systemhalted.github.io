<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not long ago that we were discussing how journalists in India and Japan differ when it come to <a class="zem_slink" title="Journalism ethics and standards" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism_ethics_and_standards" rel="wikipedia">journalistic ethics</a>. We praised Japanese for not showing any scenes of <strong><em>the horror, the trauma, and the human suffering inflicted by the tsunami</em>. </strong>We talked and wrote about how we wanted that Indian journalists do the same and newspapers and news-channels have some sense of humanity and responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We talked and wrote a lot about it and thought this and thought these knowledgeable persons, with a power of pen in their hand will have a note of it next time (God forbid) any such event happens. The event happened - three blasts in Mumbai - and the same old journalistic drama begun. The Hindu, which I religiously follow, was not far behind and published the pictures saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Scores of people were injured, some critically, as blasts struck Dadar, Zaveri Bazaar and Opera House areas of Mumbai within minutes of each other on Wednesday evening.</div>
</blockquote>
<div id="body">
<div>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Some of the pictures of people injured or killed in the Mumbai bomb explosions may cause distress to readers. <span style="color:#ff0000;">They are being published to show the horror, the trauma, and the human suffering inflicted by the terrorist attacks.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>-- <strong><em> </em><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2224415.ece">The Hindu, Jul 13, 2011</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What a joke? They have no sensibility but have all the ability to get sensationalise the things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May they (journalists) all be damned and doomed and go to HELL and their souls never RIP.</p>
