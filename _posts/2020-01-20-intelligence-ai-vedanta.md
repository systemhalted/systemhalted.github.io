### Intelligence - What is it?

Meriam-Webster dictionary defines **intelligence** as \"(1) the ability
to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations, (2) the
ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think
abstractly as measured by objective criteria (such as tests).\" In my
view, (2) definition is very close to the meaning of Intelligence and
many psychologists agree[^1] [^2].

Hence, something to be considereed intelligent, it must have:

-   the ability to apply knowlege

-   the ability to pass the objective tests of `intelligence` or
    `knowledge application`

### Test of Intelligence

Now, the question appears how can you objectively test the intelligence?
When talking about machines, first thing that comes into mind is the
Alan Turing's *Imitation Game*[^3] paper which defines the
test for intelligence of machine. The test is widely known as Turing
Test. In summary, it says that if there is a machine, a human and a
judge and if the machine is able to deceive the judge that *it is a
human and human is a machine*, then it has passed the test of
intelligence.

For purpose of this paper, however, I will be defining my own test based
on Hindu Philosophy known as *Advaita Vedanta*. In summary, ***Advaita
Vedanta*** [^4] [^5] talks about the ways to seek
spiritual liberation through acquiring `vidya` or knowledge. The text
talks at length about cognition, the means of acquiring knowledge and
provides proofto ascertain that the knowedlge has been acquired. Since,
as students of AI we are interested in the proof of `gain of knowledge`
or intelligence, there is no other text that goes deep into this subject
of epistemology. Advaita Vedanta talks about six *pramanas* or proofs.
They are:

1.  Pratyaksha (perception): acquiring knowledge through sesnses and
    worldly objects. In case of AI, if an agent can acquire knowledge
    without any supervision

2.  Anumana (inference): applying reason to reach a conclusion from one
    or more observations or previous understanding. If an AI can use
    it's knowledge to reach a connclusion, it is an intelligent AI.

3.  Upamana (comparison, analogy): gaining knowledge through comparison
    and analogy. For example, in case of Raven's Progressive Matrices,
    the KBAI agent can generate the candidate answer images and then use
    comparison to identify the correct answer.

4.  Arthapatti (postulation): generally means implications, for e.g.
    *if\...then* statements, similar to Production Systems discussed in
    section 2 above. It can also means the assumption of existence, fact
    or truth.

5.  Anuplabdhi (non-perception or negative/cognitive proof): It says
    that knowledge of something's non-existence or non-perception is a
    valid proof of intelligence. For example, if Watson can prove that
    there is no question or fact that supports the answer then it will
    be considered intelligent.

6.  Shabda (word): Relying on past knowledge of experts like teachers,
    parents, etc. In case of AI, it will be equivalent to Supervised
    Learning

We can use these as parameters to test an AI Agent. If an agent is able
to do perform well on each of these parameters then it is a intelligent
enough to be an general AI otherwise low score on these will mean narrow
AI or not an AI. These scores can be used to easily compare Agents vs
Agents or Agents vs Humans in terms of intelligence.

### Is Watson Intelligent? Is it more intelligent than Jennings and Rutter?
In 2011, the Watson computer system won the TV game of Jeopardy! against champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings. Let's check if Watson was more intelligent based on the above Test of Intelligence.

Let's check the following table:

  |Pramana (Proof)  |                Watson |  Jennings |  Rutter |  Comments |
  Pratyaksha (Perception)   |      No     |  Yes     |   Yes   |   Watson cannot on it's own acquire knowledge. It has to be taught.|
  Anumana (inference)    |         Yes    |  Yes     |   Yes   |   Watson can use its knowledge base to quickly infer the essence and thus reply. |
  Upamana (comparison, analogy)  | Yes   |   Yes    |    Yes    |  Watson is good at comparison and so are the humans|
  Arthapatti (postulation)  |      Yes   |   Yes |       Yes |     Watson can use his knoweldge base to postulate and draw conclusions|
  Anuplabdhi (non-perception) |    No    |   Yes  |      Yes |     Since Watson cannot acquire knowledge on it's own, it can not guaranteedly proof the non-existence.|
  Shabda (Word)      |             Yes  |    Yes    |    Yes  |    Only way for Watson to learn is through Supervised learning |
  Total Intelligence Score    |    4   |     6   |       6   |     Hence, we can say Jennings and Rutter are more intelligent|

Thus, using the *pramanas* above, we have proved that Watson is not as
intelligent as Humans. It is at best a narrow AI, which is good at tasks
for which it has been made. But for other tasks it is not as intelligent
as humans. The power of perception and non-perception and to reason for
them is what makes humans different from machines.
