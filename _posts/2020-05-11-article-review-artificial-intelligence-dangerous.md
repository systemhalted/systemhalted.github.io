### Summary

 The author[^1] starts the article by mentioning the concerns raised by Elon Musk, et.al and talks about the difference between Narrow AI and General AI. Then it mentions 6 AI risks, viz., autonomous weapons, social ma- nipulation, invasion of privacy and social grading, misalignment between human goals and that of machine, and discrimination.

### Evaluation 

This article is very simple and it accurately portrays the risk associated with AI. I will argue that though I have put the article in negative section, it is realist and shows the growing concerns with the evolution of AI. Toronto Declaration, that we discussed in previous section, addresses few of the risks like discrimination mentioned in the article.
