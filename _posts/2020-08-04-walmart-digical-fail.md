I was at a Walmart store in Bashford Manor in Louisville with my brother-in-law to return an item that was bought on Walmart.com and the return was initiated online but for the return to a store. 
But it seems their systems don’t talk and we were unable to return. It had been an hour that we had been trying to chat, call Walmart.com agents and 
talk with the store associates with 0 success thus far.

Apparently, Walmart has stopped accepting returns in store for the products sold online (as per the agent with whom we were in touch on phone). 
It feels strange that why did the website/mobile app still allows to select store return and there was no communication of any sort from Walmart in this regard till we were at the store and even then we had to call Walmart to figure this out. 
Why can’t associates at the store talk to their online counterparts? 

It was a "Bad" customer experience. Digital is difficult, Digical is deadly - getting it right needs synergy across the organization.
