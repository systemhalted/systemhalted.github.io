Testing is important. Testing software is important. But testing can not guarantee a perfect product. It can provide information that can be used to mitigate risk of releasing a product.

Also, for a perfect product, you need perfect and exhaustive testing and as Gerald M. Weinberg[^1] said in his book Perfect Software[^2], this will require an infinite number of tests, which will require more time than the life of a product itself.

Edsger W. Dijkstra[^3] said, “Testing may convincingly demonstrate the presence of bugs, but can never demonstrate their absence.” So, use tests to gain the information about bugs in your program/product. And fix them. Do not let the presence of bugs shame you if your testing caught them. You will not have a perfect product but you are at least mitigating the risk to not have a low quality one.
