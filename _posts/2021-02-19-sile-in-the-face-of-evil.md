"Silence in the face of evil is itself evil!" There was a time when it was easy to criticize the government. Now, the situation is that if you criticize the government, you are anti-national or are not a patriot. This is a kind of global phenomenon. Even world’s oldest and largest democracies are suffering. Hope they both heal soon!
