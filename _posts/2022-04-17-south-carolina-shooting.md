Today was another shooting. This time in a [South Carolina restaurant](https://abcnews.go.com/US/injured-shooting-south-carolina-restaurant-police/story?id=84135698&fbclid=IwAR1RH0hnWci0e7yBiFtjjIoqKNFxuZZa1Uj_Rrj-OwNNYcY1XkcmBebFJ3k).
                          
I didn’t feel a thing today. And then I did some. 

When the shootings become a norm and the people become insensitive to such regular occurrence, then you have not only a law and order problem or constitutional problem, you have a bigger societal issues that need to be addressed.

The biggest disadvantage of shallow capitalism is the lobbyists. They will do whatever they can do to undermine every positive thing that the government might want to bring, toward one end - profits. Gun lobby is the same. The mind control game that it plays is so feudal that even the people from feudal age will be in for a ride.
