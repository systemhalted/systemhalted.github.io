Greek musician [Vangelis](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO2Pv5ZK?si=CctPb0kfSJGkG_R4PRGztA) died last month on May 17 in Paris. He was 79. I loved his music. I accidentally came across him on Spotify four years ago. Rajesh Roshanâ€™s music is all thanks to this Greek genius.

Om Shanti!
