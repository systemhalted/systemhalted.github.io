After hearing great reviews and procrastinating the trauma that unfolded right in 2008 for a long time watched Major on Netflix today. It is the story of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, martyr of 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. He died protecting the country at Taj Hotel. He was just 31 when he martyred himself for his country.

Coming back to the movie. The movie did not do justice to Maj Sandeep Unnikrishnan by its complete disregard to reality. They turned the life and martyrdom of a hero into a masala film. The scenes at NDA and those depicting military decisions critical to a mission were shown as being made on the whims of emotions rather than any strategy. I doubt military might make decisions like that. Lakshya (2004) was a fictional account of 1999 Operation Vijay but was more real on how the story was intervowen into a movie compared to Major. 

What it gets right is the emotion part of it. The filmmakers knew that 26/11 is an emotional topic for many of us who watched the horror unfold on their TV feeling lifeless sitting in front of it not able to do anything. And they used it to sell a story which neither do justice to the martyrs and victims of 26/11 nor is it able to celebrate the life of Maj Sandeep Unnikrishnan. 

If I have to rate, I will give it 3/5. 2 marks for emotions and 1 for being committed enough to make a movie on Maj Unnikrishnan. 

I wish there is some filmmaker out there who is able to do justice and makes another movie on one of the greatest heroes of India in the 2000s.
