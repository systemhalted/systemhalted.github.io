The most important and frequent question that gets asked by people who want to explore the universe from their backyards is "which telescope should we buy?". 
Simple answer: None.

The first thing that you should do is buy a pair of binoculars. A pair of 7x50 binoculars is the best. They are easier to hold as they are not bulky and give enough magnification to appreciate and enjoy the night sky. I have a cheap $40 Celestron binoculars, which I bought from Amazon. Binoculars are interesting because you can use your both eyes, which in my humble opinion is better than the viewing that you get from a single eyepiece on a telescope.

If you are hellbent on a telescope, then go for a Dobsonian. They are simple to use and are super kidâ€™s friendly. I have a 6" Dob. My 9 and 5 year olds can handle it independently. It is worth it.
