Watched Gandhi with Rayirth today.  He had read about him in the school but I thought it would be a good idea to show him the movie. His appreciation for Gandhi and India’s Struggle for Independence increased manifold. 

Gandhi, the movie, is a subtle introduction to the events that shaped Gandhi and hence India. 

Gandhiji was called Bapu (father) and Mahatma (great soul) because he touched the masses unlike many leaders. He transformed way of life for many leaders specially Pt. Nehru and Sardar Patel. But one person he couldn’t change was Jinnah. Jinnah, with his self-invented fear for Muslims, disagreed anything which could unify Hindu and Muslims. I think he was afraid that if the separate electorates based on religion were not ensured, chances of him becoming a parliamentarian would become thin. He chose to divide India for his hunger for power. 

Jinnah created Pakistan, the country whose premise was based on power struggle. And history gives enough evidence what with country being under Dictatorship for most of its independent years. Gandhiji would have been sad to see the state of Pakistan. 

Gandhiji died without any official title but thankfully his teachings shaped the leaders like Sardar Patel and Pt Nehru, who shaped India. 

He is truly a Father of a Nation, "Bapu".
