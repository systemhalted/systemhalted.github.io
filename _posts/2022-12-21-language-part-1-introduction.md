Yesterday, my son Rayirth asked why his teacher says that English is the toughest language. While discussing it dawned to me that English is not difficult due to how the language is designed but due to the very nature of the script it uses. For example, cut and put are pronounced differently but written similarly. Thus, one thing is clear that language is not same as the script. Then what is language? How do we define language? In this series of post, I am going to tackle this question and discuss various aspects or components of language. This is the first post in the series where I will try to understand what is a language and how is it useful for human communication. 

Before I start, a disclaimer. I am not a linquist and have no knowledge about languages. Even though I am filing this under `Linguistic` category, it is more of my `Insane Thoughts` and thus is twin filed under that category as well. 

Language is a fundamental aspect of human communication. It is a system of symbols, sounds, and gestures that we use to express our thoughts, feelings, and ideas to others. Language allows us to convey complex information, share our knowledge and experiences, and connect with others on a deeper level.

But what exactly is language? It can be difficult to define, as it is a complex and multifaceted system that includes many different elements. Some definitions of language include the following:

* "A system of communication by speech, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way." (Oxford English Dictionary)
 
* "A system of communication through speech, consisting of sounds, words, and grammar, or the system of communication used by a particular country or group of people." (Merriam-Webster)
 
* "A system of communication through speech or writing, that is used by humans in a particular country or community." (Cambridge Dictionary)
 
These definitions highlight the various components of language, including the use of words and grammar to convey meaning, and the role of speech or writing in communication. Language is a highly organized and structured system, with rules and conventions that vary from one language to another.

The role of language in human communication is essential. It allows us to express our thoughts, ideas, and emotions in a way that can be understood by others. Without language, we would be unable to share our knowledge and experiences, or to connect with others in a meaningful way. Language is also a key aspect of culture, as it reflects the values, beliefs, and traditions of a particular group of people.

As we can see from these definitions, language is a complex and multifaceted system of communication that plays a vital role in human interaction. It allows us to express ourselves and understand others, and it is an essential part of who we are as human beings.
