Vocabulary is an essential part of language that refers to the set of words that we use to express our thoughts, feelings, and ideas. It is a key aspect of effective communication, as it allows us to express a wide range of concepts and ideas in a clear and concise manner.

Vocabulary can be defined as the words of a language, including single items and phrases or chunks of several words which convey a particular meaning, the way individual words do. [^1]

But why is vocabulary so important in language, and how does it work? Let's take a closer look at this important aspect of communication.

One of the main reasons that vocabulary is important in language is that it allows us to express a wide range of concepts and ideas. A rich vocabulary enables us to describe and explain complex concepts, convey abstract ideas, and express our thoughts and feelings in a precise and nuanced way. It also allows us to understand and interpret the words and ideas of others, as a larger vocabulary enables us to better grasp the meaning of new or unfamiliar words.

Vocabulary is also important in language because it allows us to communicate more effectively with others. By using a wide range of words and phrases, we can convey our thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner, and we can better understand the words and ideas of others. This is especially important in professional settings, where effective communication is crucial for success.

Building and expanding your vocabulary is an ongoing process that requires practice and effort. There are many ways to improve your vocabulary, including reading widely, learning new words and phrases, and using a dictionary or thesaurus to look up unfamiliar words. By making an effort to expand your vocabulary, you can become a more effective communicator and improve your understanding of language.

When we talk about language, the most important aspect is surely grammar but vocabulary is close second. Language speakers as they come in influence of foreign language try to assimilate some of the vocabulary of the foreign language in their language use, thus enhancing their vocabulary by borrowing from the foreign language. Oxford dictionary adds 4000 new words to its repertoire every year. That means we will see increasing number of foreign language influence on English vocabulary. 

Thus vocabulary plays an important role in the development of language.
