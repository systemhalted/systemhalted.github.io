Recently Virat Kohli[^1] scored his 46th ODI[^2] century. Sachin Tendulkar[^3] has scored 100 centuries in all formats with 49 centuries in ODI. Virat has always been compared to Sachin and his recent centuries have re-started the comparison. One contention is that Sachin took 463 ODI matches to score his 49 centuries, while Virat has scored his 46 centuries in just 268 matches. 

In this debate, I stipulate that the world of sports has come a long way in the past decade. With advancements in technology and training methods, athletes are now able to push their bodies to new limits and break records that were once thought impossible. From professional athletes to weekend warriors, everyone is benefitting from these technological advancements. In this article, we will explore the ways in which technology and training methods have improved the performance of athletes and what we can expect to see in the future.

One of the biggest advancements in technology that has impacted the world of sports is the development of wearable technology. From fitness trackers to smart watches, athletes are now able to track their performance in real-time. This allows them to monitor their heart rate, distance, and pace while they are training and competing. This data can then be used to make adjustments to their training regimen and fine-tune their performance.

Another important aspect of sports performance that has been greatly impacted by technology is the clothing athletes wear. Breathable clothing has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. Breathable clothing can have a positive impact on sports performance by helping to regulate an athlete's body temperature. When an athlete is participating in physical activity, their body generates heat, which can cause them to become overheated and fatigued. Breathable clothing allows sweat to evaporate through the fabric, helping to cool the body and keep the athlete comfortable. This can help to prolong endurance and improve overall performance.

Yet another way that technology is transforming the world of sports is through the use of video analysis. With the help of cameras and software, coaches and trainers are now able to analyze an athlete's technique and identify areas for improvement. This allows them to make adjustments to the athlete's training regimen in order to improve their performance. You can see the spider cameras all around. In cricket, the stump camera and technology like ball tracking and Ultra Edge [^4] to confirm if the ball hit the bat have changed the way the game is played. 

In addition to technology, training methods have also seen significant advancements in recent years. One of the biggest changes has been the shift towards functional training. Rather than focusing on isolated muscle groups, functional training focuses on the body as a whole and trains the muscles to work together. This type of training is more effective for athletes because it helps to improve their overall movement patterns, making them more efficient and less prone to injury.

Another training method that has become increasingly popular is high-intensity interval training (HIIT). This type of training involves short bursts of high-intensity activity followed by periods of rest or low-intensity activity. Research has shown that HIIT is an effective way to improve cardiovascular fitness and increase muscle mass. This makes it an ideal training method for athletes who need to be in top physical condition.

Nutrition and dietary supplements are also playing a bigger role in the performance of athletes. With the help of sports scientists and nutritionists, athletes are now able to tailor their diets to meet their specific needs. This includes things like consuming the right types of carbohydrates to fuel their bodies during training and competition, and taking supplements to support their recovery and overall health.

Finally, medical treatments and recovery techniques have also improved in recent years. Athletes are now able to access a wide range of treatments, from physical therapy to regenerative medicine. These treatments help to speed up the recovery process, allowing athletes to get back to training and competing more quickly.

In conclusion, the advancements in technology and training methods have had a significant impact on the performance of athletes. From wearable technology to functional training, these advancements have allowed athletes to push their bodies to new limits and break records that were once thought impossible. With technology continuing to evolve, we can expect to see even more improvements in the future. Athletes and coaches will continue to use data and analytics to track performance and make training and game-time decisions. As a result, we will see even more athletes achieving new heights of excellence in their respective sports.
