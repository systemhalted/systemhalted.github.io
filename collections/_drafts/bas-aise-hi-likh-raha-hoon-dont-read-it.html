<p><span style="font-family:verdana;">At 8:50am in the morning, my cell phone rang. I was sleeping at that time, so it took some time for me before I realised that my mobile was ringing. I picked it up to know that Gajendra was online. It was least expected as yesterday only he told me that he is going to Ratnagiri with some friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana;">He told me the programme has been cancelled and asked me to reach office. I finished the morning chores in half an hour and left for office. It took 25 min to reach Sanghavi Phata (walking). I waited for Infosys' bus and finally reached office by 6-seater. Gajendra and Pallav followed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana;">We decided to study for certification, but none of us could hardly read. We turned on music and went into our dreams. </span></p>
