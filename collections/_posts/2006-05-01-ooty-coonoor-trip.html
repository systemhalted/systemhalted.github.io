<p style="text-align:justify;"># A letter to Sunanda Mainji on 1st May 2006</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Respected mainji,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">JRJK!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a long weekend and we have a holiday today also on account of May Day. So, we decided to visit <a class="zem_slink" title="Ootacamund" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ootacamund">OOTY</a> and COONOOR.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We left <a class="zem_slink" title="Mysore" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=12.3,76.65&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=12.3,76.65%20%28Mysore%29&amp;t=h">Mysore</a> on <a class="zem_slink" title="Saturday morning cartoon" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_morning_cartoon">Saturday morning</a> at 2am by taxi. It takes nearly 6 hours to reach OOTY. We reached OOTY at 6:30am. We slept till 10am. At 11:30am we left the Guest House and went to see OOTY Lake. After boating we hired a Taxi for <a class="zem_slink" title="Tourism" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism">sight-seeing</a>. We visited Pykara Lake and Pykara Falls. The lake was extremely beautiful. Falls were okay but not of the types that we find in <a class="zem_slink" title="Himalayas" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=27.9880555556,86.9252777778&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=27.9880555556,86.9252777778%20%28Himalayas%29&amp;t=h">Himalayas</a> like that in <a class="zem_slink" title="Mussoorie" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=30.45,78.08&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=30.45,78.08%20%28Mussoorie%29&amp;t=h">Mussoorie</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Nainital" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=29.38,79.45&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=29.38,79.45%20%28Nainital%29&amp;t=h">Nainital</a>. But we enjoyed a lot. From there we went to Biological Garden. Then we went to market and ate dinner. We returned to the Guest House at 11:30pm. We went to the market nearby to drink tea. Next day, ie on Sunday, we left for the rly stn to catch the Toy train for COONOOR. But the tickets were already sold and the counter was closed. So again we hired the same taxi for <a class="zem_slink" title="Coonoor" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=11.35,76.82&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=11.35,76.82%20%28Coonoor%29&amp;t=h">Coonoor</a>. First of all we went to see <a class="zem_slink" title="Doddabetta" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=11.4024166667,76.7367222222&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=11.4024166667,76.7367222222%20%28Doddabetta%29&amp;t=h">Dodabetta</a> - the highest peak of OOTY.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From there we went to Coonoor. We visited Lam's Rock, Dolphin Nose View points and also a tea factory. Then we left for OOTY and reached OOTY at 3:15pm. We bought chocolates from the market as <a class="zem_slink" title="Ootacamund" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=11.38,76.7&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=11.38,76.7%20%28Ootacamund%29&amp;t=h">Ooty</a> is famous for HOME MADE CHOCOLATES. We ate pizzas in lunch. At 4:30 pm we reached Guest House. At 6:30pm bus came to pick us and we left for Mysore.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The route between Mysore and Ooty passes through Bandipur Wild Life Sanctuary. We were lucky enough to see a tiger, snakes and deers on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We reached Mysore at 11:30pm and our campus at 12am. We played basketball for sometime and returned to our rooms at 1:30am.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That was brief description of our Ooty-Coonoor trip. We have taken many photographs. Will show you when we meet.<br />
Rest is fine.</p>
