<p><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;">The Pope's recent speech in which he condemns Islam has caused a furore all over the world. This act of his has not only caused anger and rage amongst Muslims but have also led the world to the verge of division. There was a problem named Bush, but now Pope has also came into the league. </span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;">Pope should also remember that Church's (medieval) own history has been violent. The world should also understand that Islam is a religion and Islamism is a political ideology.</span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;"> I think I should stop. I don't want to be the part of any contoversies. I just hope that Pope's visit to Turkey is successful and he returns safely.</span></p>
