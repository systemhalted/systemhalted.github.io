Hi friends,

I didn’t wake up today thinking, *I must buy a TV.* It happened the way some perfectly unnecessary purchases happen: you’re roaming around, minding your own business, going nowhere, doing nothing… and then a shop window decides to interfere with your plans.

I was just wandering in **Sanghvi** when I reached the **chauraha** and spotted a TV shop. You know that moment when your eyes casually land on something and your brain goes, *That. That seems like a good idea.* No grand research. No spreadsheet comparison. No heroic consumer journey. Just pure, unfiltered impulse.

So I walked in and walked out with an **ONIDA BLACK 200 (21")**.

It cost me **Rs. 7600**.

Now here’s the funny part: this isn’t even my first Onida story. If I start counting from the very first TV my father bought, this makes it the **third TV from the Onida stable** in our little family timeline. At this point, it’s less "brand loyalty" and more "Onida has quietly been living with us for years."

## Why this one?

Because it felt like the right kind of simple.

A **21-inch** screen is exactly the sweet spot for no-fuss weekend living: big enough to enjoy a movie without squinting, small enough to not turn the room into a theatre. The "Black 200" name sounds like it should come with a cape, but what I really bought was a promise: lazy Saturdays, unplanned films, cricket that stretches into the evening, and that comfort of having something playing while life slows down.

Honestly, I bought it **for the sake of it**.

And I kind of love that.

Here’s to better weekends, to accidental decisions that turn out nicely, and to Onida… for somehow always showing up again.
