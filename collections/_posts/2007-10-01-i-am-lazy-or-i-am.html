<p>Sometimes I think, what to blog and at others why to blog? I want to write everything but when I sit in front of this machine I feel like "Leave it" or "Anyways, who cares?". </p>
<p>I have evfen not updated my diary since July. I am so lazy.</p>
<p>I feel like leaving this job and return back to my home town Agra. I miss my parents. On Sunday, my mon got operated and I was here in Pune. Sometimes I think for whom am I working -- my family, my parents, then why I am so far from them??</p>
