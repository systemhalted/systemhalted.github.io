<p>Whenever I think a goal is accomplished, another goals starts blinking and I head towards it. On the way there comes hurdles and I think that I should leave and return back. But with GOD grace, I reach the goal again. </p>
<p>I just thank GOD that thy is with me. I only want him to stay by my side and help me in attaining goals after goal by giving me zeal and power to perform my task honestly.</p>
<p>There is more to come my way!!</p>
