<p>There are times when you loose enthusiasm to be with your near and dear ones, your close friends and want to live in solitude for some time. It is what is happening with me right now. I feel a loss of enthusiasm, excitement, and joy. I feel like I am enjoying my own pain.</p>
<p>The main thing that drags me into this situation is that I don't say anything to anyone when he say something wrong to me. My incapability to say anything in such situations make me unhappy, grim and sick. </p>
<p>I have tried several times to be ingenuous but never succeeded and all my attempts have gone in vain.</p>
<p>What shall I do???</p>
