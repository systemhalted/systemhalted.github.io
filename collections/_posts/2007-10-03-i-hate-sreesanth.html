<p>He is just an I*I*T. I don't know who selected him. It is ok to be agressive but at the same time baby PERFORM - Key Mantra!!!<br />But no, who cares. Will do a film, advertisments, Music album. NO CRICKET. Then why did you started playing cricket in the first place. Don't know that he has to bowl on the pitch not outside it. Wides he bowls are not wides he is just practicing a newer version of volley ball I suppose so that the opponent never get a chance to touch the ball.<br />I*I*T of number 1 category. That is what he is.</p>
