<p>So Agra was in news and that too because of our college... Anand Engineering College. And there is nothing to cheer about. It was all for bad reasons.</p>
<p><!--more-->The <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1125200">act </a>that  I am talking about is unacceptable under any circumstances. And again the reaction of the college authorities is not at all responsible one. What is needed is a strict action against these acts and to ensure that this doesn't happen in future again.</p>
<p>We are trying hard to make our college's mark in corporate world. My friends and colleagues ask about this and I feel ashamed. It is just a setback to what we have achieved so far. We are still considered to be from a state that is of no use except in politics and a college that stands nowhere. We are trying hard and working towards making a name for our college and the activities like these hinder our goal.</p>
<p>I would like the management to accept the responsibility and take necessary action to curb such act of violent ragging in future.</p>
