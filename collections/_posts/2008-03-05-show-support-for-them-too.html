<p>The news has lost its worth in the smog of Cricket wins over the last week. Can you guess what I am talking about. One more team is working hard and winning matches. But no one is bothered. If you can't guess by now, then don't feel ashamed. It is to blame to the ignorance of Indian populace and shadow of Cricket. I won't take much time to inform you all that I am talking about Indian Hockey Team (Men) who is working really hard and has won its last three matches with a large margin. They are playing in the Olympic qualifying tournament at Santiago, Chile.<br />If possible then please show some support for them too!!</p>
