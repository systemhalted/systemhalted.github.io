<p><span style="font-family:verdana;color:#000099;">Happy Birthday Mummy!!</span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#000099;">Today is my mom's birthday. Today is Mahashivratri too. And also a coincidence!! </span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#000099;">Today after many years 6th March and Mahashivratri have fallen on the same day. And same was the scenario when my mom took birth in the year 1951. As far as I remember, this is the first time since my birth that such a scenario has happened. I wish I would have been with my family at Agra, but my job restrains me. Or may be my lack of visibility and motivation towards the same. I wish I could have been with her.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#000099;">Love you Mummy!!</span></p>
