<p><span style="font-family:verdana;">Enlightenment leads to reawakening and reawakening leads to reformation!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:verdana;"><!--more-->This will lead to the formation of globally democratic society. The society that will have the ability to participate in the progress of the entire society - our home - The Earth, beyond the political boundaries, boundaries made by humans. There will be nothing like free trade rather every movement will be free. The dominance of the few will be diminished and the civilization will grow together. There will be no wars, no political threats, no terrorism, no government, no army, no police. Every individual will police himself. Laws will be universal, abiding to and enforced by all. Everyone will grow. There will be no poverty, grief or sorrow. Animals and humans will live together without thinking of superiority. And there will be one GOD - The individual himself.</span></p>
<p>Will this ever happen?</p>
