<p>As per Gandhiji, Religion is a moral order and different Religions are sets of belief systems and rituals. This is the reason he advocated entry of Religion into politics but not Religions into politics. Â Gandhi wanted India to be secular, based not on majority of any religious community but on the representatives of the whole people without distinction of religion.</p>
