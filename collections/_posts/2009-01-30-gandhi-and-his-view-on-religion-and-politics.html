<p>As per Gandhiji, Religion is a moral order and different Religions are sets of belief systems and rituals. This is the reason he advocated entry of Religion into politics but not Religions into politics.  Gandhi wanted India to be secular, based not on majority of any religious community but on the representatives of the whole people without distinction of religion.</p>
