<p>Global Warming is a 'global' issue. We all know about it and its consequences. We all want to do something about the issue but don't know where to start. So, here is an opportunity for all of us to be a part of a movement to spread awareness about Global Warming and to mitigate the growing risks due to it. Though the step is a small step, but it is only the first step towards sensibility towards our Environment that is deteriorating with time.<!--more--></p>
<p>So, please come forward. Lets begin with <strong><a href="http://www.earthhour.in/about-us.aspx">Earth Hour</a></strong>. Switch off your lights for one hour on Saturday, March 28, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm IST and join a worldwide movement against global warming.</p>
<li>Sign up and support Earth Hour at http://www.earthhour.in</li>
<li>The goal is to get 1 billion people to switch off their lights as part of a global vote.</li>
<li>New Delhi and Mumbai are among 825 cities across 80 countries and territories that have pledged their support to VOTE EARTH during Earth Hour 2009.</li>
