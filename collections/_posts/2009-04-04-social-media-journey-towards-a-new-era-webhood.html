<p style="text-align:justify;">#Cross-posted from <a href="http://techfoci.blogspot.com/2009/04/social-media-journey-towards-new-era.html" target="_blank">Tech-Foci</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Social media has come a long way. Some people have just used it and some have misused it. And few have gained too. <a class="zem_slink" title="Social media" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media" rel="wikipedia">Social Media</a> can be a powerful tool if used effectively. Many Social media sites like <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage">Facebook</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="FriendFeed" href="http://friendfeed.com/" rel="homepage">FriendFeed</a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com" rel="homepage">Twitter</a> (list is not exhaustive) help you to reach millions. Social Media has gone from the days of <a class="zem_slink" title="Orkut" href="http://www.orkut.com" rel="homepage">Orkut</a>, where you had your personal page on <a class="zem_slink" title="World Wide Web" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" rel="wikipedia">World Wide Web</a> to the stage of Market Networking, giving you a strategic platform to reach millions of audience without or less expenditure and in lesser number of minutes spent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The major reason that why Social Media has been a huge success is because the people who indulge themselves in this area believe, either knowingly or unknowingly, in <a class="zem_slink" title="Altruism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism" rel="wikipedia">ALTRUISM</a>. The basic reason for the success of <a class="zem_slink" title="Web 2.0" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0" rel="wikipedia">Web 2.0</a> is its altruistic nature. The desire to help and be helped. That is why I, and many others, like to call Web 2.0 as Altruist Web.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Blogging(Wordpress, Blogger) and <a class="zem_slink" title="Microblogging" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging" rel="wikipedia">Micro-blogging</a>(Twitter) have helped people to say what is in their mind and reach out to millions. Bookmarking sites have helped people to share links of the articles they liked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short everything which comes under Social Media realm is running because of altruism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After centuries of feudalism and then attaining nationhood, we are marching into the era of "Webhood". I just coined this term. It is powerful, more powerful than <a class="zem_slink" title="Nation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation" rel="wikipedia">Nationhood</a>. In Webhood, people belonging to different caste, creed, race, religion, and nation come together to form an altruist society which may or may not meet physically but are involved in sharing, helping and networking resources available with them with the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let's hope that Webhood will bring masses from different nations together and help in bringing the beautiful earth - Our Mother, more beautiful.</p>
