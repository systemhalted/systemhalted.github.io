<p>3rd July 2009. A guy walked into Hinjewadi Phase 2, Pune campus with a smile on face and heart filled with excitement and anxiousness. He reached the reception and he saw that he was not the only one. There were many others who had joined a day or two earlier and many who will be joining a new world along with him. He was happy that he was not alone.</p>
<p><!--more-->A week passed completing the formalities and induction training and on 17th July 2009 he joined his project team. His journey had begun. A journey full of hope and excitement, and he is traveling with the desire to achieve all that he want to. He had read about the company since his school days, when he was only 8 years old. MAINFRAME COMPUTERS, MARK  -- all were part of his Computer Science syllabus in class IV. A Dream has come true. Now he was also the part of the same group, the same company - International Business Machines or simply IBM.</p>
<p>More has to come his way - My Way!!</p>
