<p>I would like to wish all of my fellow citizens Happy Independence Day.<br />
<!--more--><br />
We are celebrating our 64th Independence Day. Pakistan celebrated its 64th Independence Day yesterday. Hope that the coming years will deplete the bitterness from both sides and we will see the progressive diplomacy and will march together towards the global success. I also wish that violence in Kashmir comes to an end. There should be solution to the agonies of the Kashmiris. I also hope that Naxalism will also end and the miseries of the poor get abated. </p>
<p>In hope that we can live with harmony together and forever.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day!!<br />
