<p>I wish to go home now. Near my dear ones. It has been more than four years now that I have been staying away from my home. Wish to go back there or at least near it. I work in IT industry and we don't have IT companies in my hometown. So nearest place would be NCR. So, I wish to go back there. I just wish it happens soon. Missing <a class="zem_slink" title="Delhi" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=28.61,77.23&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=28.61,77.23%20%28Delhi%29&amp;t=h">Delhi</a> and <a href="http://agra.nic.in">Agra</a>!!</p>
