excerpt: 'Much has been made of the decision to put the Prime Minister under the purview
  of the proposed corruption watchdog, the Lokpal, but the official draft of the Lokpal
  Bill is full of escape clauses for politicians. All critical decisions in the proposed
  anti-corruption regime will remain firmly in the hands of the ruling dispensation,
  although that is the main cause for the widespread impunity for scams involving
  politicians. In fact, the official draft, which may be promulgated as an ordinance
  soon, is hardly an improvement on the current situation. Civil society has proposed
  an option with more teeth. '

<tr>
<td>1. The Lokpal will have jurisdiction only over the Prime Minister, ministers and MPs.</td>
<td>1. The Lokpal will have jurisdiction over  politicians, bureaucrats and judges. The CVC and the entire vigilance  machinery of the Centre will be merged into the Lokpal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. The  Lokpal will not have suo motu power to initiate inquiry or even receive  complaints of corruption directly from the public. The complaints will  be forwarded to it by the presiding officer of either House of  Parliament.</td>
<td>2. The Lokpal can not only initiate action  on its own but it can also entertain complaints directly from the  public. It will not need reference or permission from any authority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. It is  purely an advisory body and can therefore only give recommendations to  the Prime Minister on complaints against ministers and to the presiding  officer of either House on complaints against the Prime Minister and  MPs.</td>
<td>3. After completing its investigation  against a public servant, the Lokpal can initiate prosecution or order  disciplinary proceedings or both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Since it has no police powers, the Lokpal cannot register an FIR on any complaint. All it can do is a preliminary inquiry.</td>
<td>4. With the corruption branch of the CBI  merged into it, the Lokpal will be able to register FIRs, conduct  investigations under the Criminal Procedure Code and launch prosecution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Anybody  found to have lodged a false complaint will be punished summarily by the  Lokpal with imprisonment ranging from one year to three years.</td>
<td>5. The Lokpal can only impose financial penalties for complaints found to be false.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. The  Lokpal will consist of three members, all of whom will be retired  judges. This may aggravate the trend of retiring judges becoming  vulnerable to government pressures.</td>
<td>6. The Lokpal will consist of 10 members  and one chairperson, out of whom only four are required to have legal  background without necessarily having any judicial experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. The  committee to select Lokpal members will consist entirely of political  dignitaries and its composition is loaded in favour of the ruling party.</td>
<td>7. The selection committee will consist of  members from judicial background, chief election commissioner,  comptroller and auditor general of India and international awardees  (like Nobel prize winners and Magsaysay awardees of Indian origin). The  bill prescribes a transparent and participatory selection process in  great detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8. If a  complaint against the Prime Minister relates to subjects like security,  defence and foreign affairs, the Lokpal is barred from probing those  allegations.</td>
<td>8. There is no such bar on the Lokpal's powers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9. Though a  time limit of six months to one year has been prescribed for the Lokpal  to conduct its probe, there is no limit for completion of trial, if  any.</td>
<td>9. The Lokpal will have to complete its  investigation within one year and the subsequent trial will have to be  over in another year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10.  Nothing has been provided in law to recover ill-gotten wealth. After  serving his sentence a corrupt person can come out of jail and enjoy  that money.</td>
<td>10. Loss caused to the government due to corruption will be recovered from all those proved guilty.&nbsp;</p>
