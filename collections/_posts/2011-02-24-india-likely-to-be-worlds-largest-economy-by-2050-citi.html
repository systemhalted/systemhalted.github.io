<p>In view of its continuing robust growth, <a class="zem_slink" title="India" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> is expected to be the world's <a class="zem_slink" title="Lists of countries by GDP" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_countries_by_GDP">largest economy</a> by 2050, surpassing <a class="zem_slink" title="China" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a> and the US, a <a class="zem_slink" title="Citigroup" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup">Citi</a> report said.  The estimates are based on <a class="zem_slink" title="Purchasing power parity" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">purchasing power parity (PPP)</a>, an <a class="zem_slink" title="Economic growth" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth">economic growth</a> indicator that takes into account the purchasing power of each country's currency, instead of the prevailing <a class="zem_slink" title="Exchange rate" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate">exchange rate</a> conversion (<a class="zem_slink" title="Lists of countries by GDP" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_countries_by_GDP">GDP</a> nominal).<!--more--></p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Economy of India" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India">Indian economy</a> is expected to be nearly $ 85.97 trillion on PPP basis by 2050 from $ 3.92 trillion in 2010, Citi said. In terms of PPP, Indian economy -- valued at $ 3.78 trillion -- was at the fourth place in 2009. The country was behind the US, China and Japan, according to the World Bank.</p>
<p>Citi emphasised that a number of major changes within a relative short time are required for India to meet future challenges.</p>

<div>Noting that India's infrastructure has to be improved, Citi said the country needs to relax its "hostile attitude towards FDI", if it is to reap the benefits of rapid cross-border technology transfer that China has benefited from so greatly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"...a further round of serious deregulation of the domestic economy and further trade liberalisation are required," it noted.</p>
<p>The report said India's population of working age is expected to grow by 40.7 per cent between 2010 and 2050.</p>
<p>India has successfully raised its aggregate savings rate to levels that would allow sustained high levels of domestic capital formation (the domestic saving rate averaged 34.4 percent over 2006-2009 and the gross domestic investment rate 32.4 percent), the report added.</p>
