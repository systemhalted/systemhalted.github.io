<p>I was going through this news sometime back  so thought it is worth sharing. Here are the excerpts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Environment Ministry is considering the idea of developing bioshields comprising mangrove and non-mangrove species in coastal areas adjoining critical infrastructure projects such as <a class="zem_slink" title="Power station" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station" rel="wikipedia">power plants</a> and oil storage depots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The idea of promoting <a class="zem_slink" title="Mangrove" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove" rel="wikipedia">mangroves</a> and other biological shields to provide a ‘speed breaker’ was suggested by <a class="zem_slink" title="Agricultural science" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_science" rel="wikipedia">agricultural scientist</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Rajya Sabha" href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in" rel="homepage">Rajya Sabha</a> (Council of States) MP <a href="http://www.msswaminathan.com/">MS Swaminathan</a>. The suggestion is being followed up by the expert group appointed by Environment Minister <a class="zem_slink" title="Jairam Ramesh" href="http://www.jairamramesh.in/profile/profile.html#" rel="homepage">Jairam Ramesh</a> to evaluate additional safeguards against the risk of tsunami.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaminathan has also suggested that the coastal areas adjoining the <a class="zem_slink" title="Nuclear power" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power" rel="wikipedia">nuclear plants</a> could be declared as critically vulnerable coastline. The senior agricultural scientist said that the idea of using mangroves as line of defence against coastal storms and <a class="zem_slink" title="Tsunami" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami" rel="wikipedia">tsunamis</a> came following a discussion with older generation of Japanese scientists in 1989.</li>
</ul>
