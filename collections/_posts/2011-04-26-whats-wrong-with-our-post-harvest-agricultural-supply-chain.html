<p>Read this story:- <a href="http://goo.gl/xZMgK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/xZMgK</a></p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The linkage between the farmer and the consumer that exists now is not only inefficient and wasteful and subject to abuse and manipulation but also inimical to boosting production. Any hint of a shortage in relation to demand immediately leads to hoarding and price manipulation, leading to a spurt in the price at the consumer end without any of that higher price going back to the farmer. Such inefficient transmission of <a class="zem_slink" title="Price signal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal" rel="wikipedia">price signals</a> kills incentives on the farm to invest in more acreage, better inputs or innovative crop husbandry.</li>
</ul>
