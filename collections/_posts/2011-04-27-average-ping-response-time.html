<p>A colleague asked me what is the average ping response time for internet browsing. I surprisingly asked why did he ask me to which he replied that he saw my profile and found that I have worked as Technical Support Engineer with VCustomer and therefore thought that I will be able to answer him and help him with the slow speed that he is receiving while browsing.</p>
<p>For general internet browsing, under 200ms in most parts of the world is usually good (under 100ms if the server is in your own country). 200-400 is adequate, depending on how far away the server is, and how many nodes data has to go thru to get there (e.g., other side of the world). 400+ ms is really quite bad, but the internet will still function, it will just seem a bit sluggish.<br />
For most online gaming, aim for ~120ms or less (local servers in your own country are usually the best).<br />
LAN gaming should be below 50ms easily.</p>
