<p>For example:</p>
<p>In India majority of people are poor, and receive <a class="zem_slink" title="Subsidy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy" rel="wikipedia">subsidized</a> grains (like 1 kilo rice for 3 Rs, kerosene etc. from <a class="zem_slink" title="Public Distribution System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Distribution_System" rel="wikipedia">PDS</a> shops.</p>
<p>In America <a class="zem_slink" title="Poverty" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty" rel="wikipedia">poor people</a> are supported by Government by food stamps and social security cheques.</p>
<p>Now comparing two nations, <a class="zem_slink" title="Gross domestic product" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" rel="wikipedia">GDP</a> (<a class="zem_slink" title="Purchasing power parity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity" rel="wikipedia">PPP</a>) wise,</p>
<p>Obviously majority of Indians are poor, and majority of them get cheap- subsidized stuff, the purchasing power parity of India may look better than Americans.</p>
<p>But does it really mean India is financially more powerful than America just because Indians can buy more stuff in local market compared to Americans?</p>
<p>No, because financial activity is not limited to local market.</p>
<p>We've to import crude oil from Middle east and buy jet-planes, missiles from Russia,France and Israel.</p>
<p>We've buy pulses and onions from Africa and Pakistan(!),<strong> Those people are not going to sell us stuff with subsidy in Rupees, like we get in our local market.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They'll ask hard dollars (or gold or diamonds) as payment.</strong> So there, in <a class="zem_slink" title="Globalization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization" rel="wikipedia">international market</a>, America can purchase more crude oil, fighter-jets, missiles and onions compared to India, even though its GDP-PPP wise it may not be powerful as India.</p>
<p>Even China can buy more stuff internationally than we can, because our forex reserve is only 270 billion, while Chinese got 1400 billion $!</p>
<p>GDP at PPP gives us only picture of how much stuff we can buy within our country.</p>
<p>GDP at nominal rate ($) gives us bigger-picture of how much stuff  we can buy internationally.</p>
<p>Using GDP (nominal), it becomes easier to compare two nations' financial strength, by comparing their ability to purchase in international market in same currency (dollars). The one who has more $$, can purchase more stuff internationally.</p>
<p>So bigger the GDP (Nominal), powerful a country is financially. While in case of GDP(PPP) we cannot say with confidence that bigger the GDP (PPP) is, powerful a country  is financially, because they may be heavily-subsidizing it.</p>
