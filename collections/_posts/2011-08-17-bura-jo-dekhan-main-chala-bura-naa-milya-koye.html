<blockquote>लोग आये जंतर मंतर पे<br />
तालियाँ पीटी,चीखे-चिल्लाए<br />
कैमरे के सामने उछले-कूदे,माइक पे गीत गाये<br />
जोर-जोर से लगाए नारे<br />
अमर रहे अन्ना हजारे<br />
सरकार को गालियाँ दे रहे थे जब सारे<br />
मुझे याद आ रहा था वो गाना<br />
जिसने पाप न किया हो,वो पहला पत्थर मारे.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just read this poem on FB. Thought it is good to share. Today in the morning, there was a group in motor-cycle who was crying slogans to support Anna Hazare and against corruption. On a crossing the Red Light was ON. I was standing there waiting for it to turn green when these guys came from behind and over-stepped the STOP line. I asked the person driving on the bike, does he thinks that he is not corrupt.  Soon, it was about to turn green ( 3-4 seconds remaining) when he crossed the road without waiting for the traffic signal to turn green. I was just wondering whether he and his friends understand the meaning of corruption and the reason that it prevails in our society.  As Kabir had said,</p>
<p>Bura Jo Dekhan Main Chala, Bura Naa Milya Koye<br />
Jo Mann Khoja Apnaa, To Mujhse Bura Naa Koye</p>
<p>I searched for the crooked, met not a single one<br />
When searched myself, "I" found the crooked one</p>
<p>Until and unless we improve ourselves, how can we think of improving others?</p>
