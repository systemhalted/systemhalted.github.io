<p style="text-align:justify;">In June this year (2011), 7<sup>th</sup> Regional Consultation on Electoral Reforms  was held in Guwahati. A number of measures have been proposed by various committees on different issues.  I am just copying them from its press release for ready reference. These measures, including the ones proposed by previous Committees, on the issue of Electoral Reforms are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><!--more-->Criminalisation of Politics</strong></p>

<li>Provide for the use of ‘totalizer’ for counting of votes cast at more than one polling station where EVMs are used, so that the trend of voting in individual polling station areas does not get divulged and the electors may not be subjected to any harassment or victimization on that account</li>
<li>Reduction in proliferation of candidates – (1) increase deposit required to contest elections or give election Commission power to revise deposit amount before each election, (2) special measures to deter independent and non-serious candidates</li>

<li>Amendment of law to provide for filing of election petition even against defeated candidates on the ground of corrupt practice</li>
<li>Restrictions on opinion polls</li>

<li>Ban on transfer of officers likely to serve elections six months prior to date of expiry of  a fixed term or from date of dissolution of the House (in case of premature dissolution)</li>
<li>False declaration in connection with conduct of elections to be an offence  (such as false complaints of booth capturing or conduct of election officials)</li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Regulating Political Parties</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Amendment to Representation  of the People Act, 1951 to authorising the Election Commission to issue necessary orders regulating registration and de-registration of political parties</li>
<li>Election Commission should progressively increase the threshold criterion for recognition</li>
<li>Provide strict rules regulating necessary provisions in rules and by-laws of parties  to qualify for registration</li>

<li>Compulsory annual publishing of accounts by political parties</li>
<li>Auditing of accounts of  political parties by Comptroller and Auditor General</li>
<li>Any receipt by a political party either directly or through the executives or the party functionaries should be deposited in the Bank Accounts  of such parties</li>

<li>Penalties for non-compliance in publishing accounts or furnishing false financial information, including fines and/or deregistration</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Adjudication of Election Disputes</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Special election benches designated for election petitions only should be formed in the High Court</li>
<li>Special Election Tribunals should be constituted at the regional level under article 329B of the Constitution to ensure speedy disposal of election petitions and disputes within a stipulated period of six months, comprising a High Court judge and a senior civil servant with at least 5 years experience in the conduct of elections (not below the rank of an Additional Secretary to the Government of India/Principal Secretary of a State Government)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Review of Anti-Defection Law</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Penalties for disqualification on grounds of defection should be decided by the President/Governor concerned under the advice of the Election Commission, instead of relying on the objectivity of the decision from the Speaker.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Suggestions made by Navin Chawla, Former Election commissioner</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aberrations in the electoral system are</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Disregard for expenditure limits,</li>
<li>Criminality among some candidates and</li>
<li>Paid news</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Expressing optimism that the growing impatience of the youth with the major problems that beset the electoral system would lead to changes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Suggestions</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>For limiting expenditure, there ought to be a combination of regulatory and self-regulatory mechanisms. Most candidates would be income tax assessees and possess Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards. This fact could be utilised to monitor their expenses through the income tax authorities themselves.</li>
<li>Candidates can open accounts, and expenses out of it can be scrutinised by the respective Income Tax Officers. The ITO's views can be given at the first instance to the EC, which also has its own observers.</li>
<li>With their help, the EC should take a final view which, in any case, will be justifiable State funding, doing away with the limit or raising it by two or three times were all options, but there was little unanimity</li>
<li>Disqualifying those against who charges had been framed for ‘heinous offences' such as murder, attempt to murder and rape that could attract prison terms of five years and above</li>
<li>If only political parties gave up the tendency to see ‘winnability' as the sole criterion for selecting candidates, and saw the electoral arena as a level playing field from which criminality ought to be eased out, they could address this problem</li>
<li>By-elections could be a true test of public opinion. It will be less than fair if we don't hold them or deny representation to any constituency</li>
</ul>
