<p>After trying for more than two hours, I have lost the patience and I feel exhausted. Somehow I have gathered energy to write this post.</p>
<p>Before we begin, ere are two screenshots of the <a href="http://pgportal.gov.in/Grievance.aspx">Lodge a Grievance Page</a>.</p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2012/06/Gievance%2520Portal%2520Blank%2520Pt%25201.JPG" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2012/06/Gievance%2520Portal%2520Blank%2520Pt%25202.JPG" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I tried to lodge a grievance against Ministry of Railways but I was not able to submit it. Why? Check this screenshot:-</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2012/06/Gievance%2520Portal%2520Error.JPG" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I got two errors:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Description should be less than 4000 characters</li>
<li>Special Characters are not allowed in <strong>Subject description</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Those among you who are in IT will say that I must have used special characters and the characters used would be more than 4000. I checked all this, the message that I was trying to post here didn't had any special characters. Moreover, just check the screen shots, and let me know where can I find Subject description?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2012/06/Gievance%2520Portal%2520Description.JPG" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I have masked the content as I do not want to publish for the sake of anonymity. You can clearly see the following message above the Description text area:-</p>
<blockquote><p>*Please enter Grievance Description upto 3634 characters</p></blockquote>
<p>Compare this with the second image above. It clearly means that there are 3634 characters left. For special characters, I would like you to take my word. There are no special characters. I have even removed any full stop, commas, etc or for that matter I have not even included any number.</p>
<p>Now, tell me what should I do? Where shall I file a grievance against the Public Grievance Portal?</p>
