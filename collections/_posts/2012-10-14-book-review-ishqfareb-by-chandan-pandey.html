<p style="text-align:left;">Recently, I got an opportunity to read a Hindi book IshqFareb authored by Chandan Pandey. The book consists of three short stories all telling the story about Love and Hatred, Love and Betrayal and stories are all weaved with how love is cheated with treachery.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Chandan Pandey is a winner of Indian Jnanpeeth Navlekhan Award 2007 and truly, his stories and way of writing deserve this prize. It is encouraging to see that people are still writing in Hindi when our entire generation is focusing on the English Literature by Indian Authors.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Writing of Chandan Pandey is lucid and very contemporary. I felt a kind of relief in reading the stories and felt that the future of Hindi Literature will be bright only if writers and authors in Hindi of the likes of Chandan Pandey are encouraged. I thank <a class="zem_slink" title="Penguin Books" href="http://www.penguin.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Penguin India</a> to take up the cause of Hindi Literature and welcome their step to publish novels and story books in Hindi language.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now coming back to the book. The book has three stories: ‘City Public School, Varanasi’, “Shehar Ki Khudai Mein Kya Kuchh Milega”, and “Revolver”. The First one is set in a co-ed school and brings you the memory of school days. The story is about three teenagers and a kind of love triangle narrated beautifully.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The second one is set in college and though my college life is not anywhere near the act, it really is touching to see the two lover separated due to miscommunication and suspicion. Another brilliantly told story.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The third one Revolver is about betrayal, hatred and crime and this one certainly steals the show. The kind of thought gone behind this story is amazing and how much I enjoyed reading is hard to express in words.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There were certain negatives like lack of enough proof reading and certain grammatical mistakes. These I think can be easily ignored. I also did not like the paper on which the book is printed. I know it can be resolved if we get more Hindi readers to buy, love and buy again the Hindi books, as it will then only be economical to publish these books in the choice of papers that they actually deserve to be printed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Rating:</b> With hope for the best for the Hindi Literature, I would rate the book <strong>4/5</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b>Final Verdict:</b> Must read for Hindi enthusiasts and lovers.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><strong>P.S.:- I received this book as a gift from the publishers, Penguin India in exchange of a review of this book on my blog. </strong></em></p>
