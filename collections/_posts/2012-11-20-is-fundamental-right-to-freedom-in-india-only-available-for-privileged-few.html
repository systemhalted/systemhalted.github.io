<p>Part III of The Constitution of India guarantees Fundamental Rights to citizens of India which includes right to freedom of speech and expression. However, with series of recent incidents that have taken place, it seems that it is available only to few people who have reach and means to show their clout - physical or monetary. &nbsp;And the recent incident of the arrest of 2 girls for posting their point of view (totally harmless from any perception) only aggravates this view and issue. &nbsp;Have we totally lost it?</p>
<p>The FB comment posted by Shaheen Dhada, one of the girl arrested for "hurting religious sentiments" just mentions that there was no need for the bandh because one leader of a political party has died. And just asked why can't anyone remember the great martyrs like Bhagat Singh, Azad, Sukhdev or any of the likes because of whom we are living in a free India. But are we really living in a free India? Or we are living on the whims and mercy of the political mafias and gundas?</p>
<p>And the police seems to lost it totally. There is a saying in Hindi,</p>
<blockquote><p>पढ़े पर गुड़ें नहीं</p>
<p>Read but neither understood nor imbibed. (rough translation)</p></blockquote>
<p>The policemen (barring few) are just doing jobs because they couldn't clear any other exam. Or it was the last resort for them. How do you expect such people without passion for their job do the rightful thing?</p>
<p>And what Shiv Sainiks are talking about. They can say anything they wish and want. They can go on&nbsp;blabbering&nbsp;hatred comments and no one will take action against them. But a common Indian doesn't even have the right to say something on something as trivial as Facebook.</p>
<p>What a Shame?</p>
