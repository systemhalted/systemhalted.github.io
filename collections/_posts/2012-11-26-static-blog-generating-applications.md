I was eager to learn what static blog really means. I came across few open source softwares like Pelican, Jekyll, Hyde, etc. and thought to give a try to hosted Pelican in the form of Calepin. Till now have not been able to post a single thing except the sample post that got created when I created my Calepin account. Trying to figure that out.
