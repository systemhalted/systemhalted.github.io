For quiet sometime now, I was searching for an app which is lightweight, has clean interface, is functional and the one that could support markdown. That search came to the conclusion with Epistle. Epistle has all the features that I listed above. It is light, has a great interface, which is clean and functional. It helps me sync my notes with Dropbox, which is a feature I had been looking for (not exactly with Dropbox, with any of the web app similar to Dropbox). Syncing is neat and fast and the notes are accessible on your devices as soon as you have completed the note on one of the devices. It supports html preview of Markdown documents (still need to try this one).

I had tried using Evernote. It is a fantastic app but an overkill for my kind of use. I like the simplicity of the app and it fits well with my Android phone and with Dropbox sync, I can rest assured that my notes are safe and can be accessed from all my Dropbox-synced devices.

Epistle requires minimal permissions while installation and that too to access the internet so that it may sync your notes with Dropbox. So, there is no harm or fear as your other data is not at risk. 

I think for people who have minimal requirements and appreciate simplicity, Epistle is a good app. Give it a try.

My Rating: 4/5.
