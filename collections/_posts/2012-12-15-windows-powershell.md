Recently, I was going through some course on Internet when I came across PowerShell. We used to work with a program called cmd.exe, but always wanted to have the usability and power that Unix command line offers. If you are using Windows 7 or later, then you just need to follow following steps:-

- Click Start.
- In "Search programs and files", type: `powershell` and press Enter. 

This will open a cmd.exe like window. 

If you are still working on Windows XP, like me, then you can download the PowerShell from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=16818).

You can try the following commands on powershell:

 - **pwd**  
     print working directory
 - **hostname**  
     computer's network name
 - **mkdir**   
     make directory
 - **cd**   
     change directory
 - **ls**   
     list directory
 - **rmdir**   
     remove directory
 - **pushd**   
     push directory
 - **popd**   
     pop directory
 - **cp**   
     copy a file or directory
 - **robocopy**   
     robust copy
 - **mv**   
     move a file or directory
 - **more**   
     page through a file
 - **type**   
     print the whole file
 - **forfiles**   
     run a command on lots of files
 - **dir -r**   
     find files
 - **select-string**   
     find things inside files
 - **help**   
     read a manual page
 - **helpctr**   
     find what man page is appropriate
 - **echo**   
     print some arguments
 - **set**   
     export/set a new environment variable
 - **exit**   
     exit the shell
 - **runas**   
     DANGER! become super user root DANGER!
 - **attrib**   
     change permission modifiers
 - **iCACLS**   
     change ownership 

I am still trying to learn these commands. Will come up with details when I know about each of them. There are few that you already know. So, let us get started.

Enjoy Powershell!!
