Early this week, after I returned from Mumbai, the first thing that I did was to create my site using Github Pages. I soon became excited enough to register a domain and use that for my site. I have been doing some research on the domains but still many things were unclear to me and I had marked them as doubts and placed them safely in a text file saved in a personal folder on my ThinkPad. 

However, on that day I was overexcited and wanted to register a domain as early as possible. From Google Ads, I had came to know that CrazyDomains.in is giving away [.in domains](http://www.registry.in/) for Rs.99/year. So, I went to CrazyDomains.in and registered the domain from there for a period of years at a total cost of Rs. 495/-. I received a mail from CrazyDomains that the Registration is awaiting approval and will take maximum 48 hours. I was fine with that. But this was where the painful days started. I sent CrazyDomains a mail the very next day about the status for which they replied the next day of my mail. The content of their mail is as follows:  

<aside class="pull-quote">
 <blockquote>
	Hello Customer ,

	Thank you for your email.

	We are so sorry for this inconvenience.

	We are currently having issue between the system and the registry.

	Our domain team is working hard to fix this issue.

	After the problem is resolved we will register your domain immediately.

	However, we are sincerely apologize again for this inconvenience.

	If you have further queries, please feel free to let us know.
</blockquote>
</aside>

I tried several time to contact them again. But didn't get response from them. I checked [.IN WhOIS](http://www.registry.in/whois/) and found that the domain that I was looking for ([palakmathur.in](http://palakmathur.in)) was yet not registered. So, I went to BigRock and contacted their Sales staff through Live Chat. They said as soon as the payment is made, the domain will be active to be used. ***NOTE***: *Here I would like to mention that while doing my research for domain registration, I had come across the list of approved registrar for .in domain and CrazyDomains.in did not feature on that list. How I forgot that is the question that I am still trying to figure out.* I soon registered the domain with BigRock. What a relief it was! I added an A Record in DNS settings, and CNAME file to my [Github repository](http://github.com/palakmathur/palakmathur.github.com) and in around 15 minutes, I could hit my domain and access my site.

As soon as I did this, I received another reply from CrazyDomains, saying:
<aside class="pull-quote">
 <blockquote>
    Dear Client,
	
	Thank you for the email.
	
	Your domain name has not yet been registered because our link with the .in registry is currently down.
	
	Once the link is back up and the name is still available for registration, your domain name will then be registered.
	
	If not, the amount will be refunded.
	
	Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have further queries.
</blockquote>

Now, I say to hell with you CrazyDomains, I have already registered the domain. It was crazy of me to deal with you. You made me go crazy and insane.

I am in my senses back. Thanks to BigRock. Hope everything remains fine. :)
