Java EE Development with Eclipse by Deepak Vohra is the book that one would like to buy and follow if one wants Tutorial/Workshop kind of environment to learn developing Java EE applications using Eclipse IDE and Oracle Weblogic Server. If you want to gain in-depth theoretical knowledge about any of the Java EE technologies, then certainly this is not the book for you but if you want to gain practical knoweldge and answers to questions like *"How To?"* then this book can surely help. 

There are ten chapters covering EJBs and Java Persisitence API (JPA), JAXB, JasperReports, Java Server Faces (JSF), Facelets, Apache Trinidad, AJAX, JAX-WS Web Services, RESTful Web Services and Spring. Each chapter details out the steps along with screenshots from development to deployment of applications. It is like you are in a class and following/copying what the teacher is doing on blackboard and therefore you need to be extra careful that you do not merely copy and paste but also understand and then follow the steps given.

My first opinion about the book is that it spoon-feeds you and I hate it. So, I had to figure out the way that it does not do so. I would recommend that you follow the advice and do not merely copy paste, try to figure out why and what the author is trying to do and then if you understand the thing do it yourself. Otherwise even after reading through all the chapters, you will not remember what you have to do and will never understand why it was done in the first place.

My rating will be 3/5. 

*P.S.:- I received this book as a gift from the publisher in return of the review on my blog(s) and other sites.*
