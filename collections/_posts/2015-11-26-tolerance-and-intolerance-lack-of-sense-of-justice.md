<div class="_209g _2vxa">People keep saying that Aamir Khan is defaming the country. Really? Is speaking out ones mind means defaming the country? No. Not at all.</div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span><span>No one is defaming the country. He is just speaking his mind out and questioning the reason for despondency which you might have not felt and he may have felt. </span></span></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span> </span></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span><span>Why anyone speaking his mind out, in case that opinion is not in favor of the government, is defaming the country? </span></span></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"></div>

<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span><span>Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of United States, said,</span></span></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"></div>
<blockquote>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span><span> It is the first responsibility of every citizen to question authority.</span></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span><span> Authority can be described in many forms and even includes the government. If you don't question the government, it soon becomes despotic. We questioned the Congress government when they did wrong. You can see where they are now - nowhere. Let us keep that power with us. And not give away that power to the government. </span></span></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span> </span></div>
<div class="_209g _2vxa"><span><span>Government is doing many things right but can it do everything right, 100% of time, I doubt. And that is when you need to question the government. Last six-seven months, though I have not stayed in India, but have got my dose of news from my parents, friends and relatives - there is a little uncertainty about how the government and the ruling party is going to handle the fascist elements in its being. Likes of Adityanath, Sadhavi, Sharma should have been nipped in the bud. But it was never done and we keep hearing leaders asking everyone who speaks out to go to the Pakistan implying that person is not a patriot and is a Pakistani agent. That is not right way to handle things. Modi needs to talk about it and reassure that sense of justice still prevails. </span></span></div>
