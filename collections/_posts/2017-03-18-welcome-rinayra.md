description: Welcome Rinayra, my princess!
---

On 13th March 2017, we welcomed our princess, Rinayra. Rinayra means princess. The spelling should have been Rinaira. But `i` was looking odd. So, we replaced it with a `y`. No numerology. Mom and baby are doing fine.

One important thing to note. I was born on 13th August. So, Rinayra shares my birth date. Rayirth was born in August 2013 and he shares the month with me. I cannot be happier.
