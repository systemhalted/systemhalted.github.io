I am not perfect. I have made mistakes and understand that many people might not have. I try fixing one and make another. I don’t know if there will be a time when I won’t make any mistakes.

For now, I am changing my personal daily log to include 4 things:-

* A thing or two I am grateful about
* A thing of two I feel I did great
* A thing or two I think I did ok but could have done better
* A thing that needs total refinement, which as of now is a blind spot for me and an action plan

I will do a monthly review of the progress I am making in the matters requiring attention - maybe will maintain a scorecard of sorts.

This post is just to remind me in case I forget. Though I am also creating a calendar entry.
