description: Carvana - Delightful experience
---
Today, I sold my car. Not to a dealer but Carvana[^fn1].

I had leased a car in 2018 - Toyota Camry SE. Recently, during my conversation with my friend, Gurjinder, he shared his nice experience with Carvana. So, I decided to give it a try. I got an offer instantaneously and within one day I was able to schedule a pick up.

The pick up happened today. The Carvana agent came and within 10 min, we were done with all the formalities and I got the payment electronically.

The experience was what we all are striving to provide our customers - painless and hassle-free. Carvana has surely nailed it.
