description: Getting the weird error while trying to open Windows Defender, follow on.

Recently I purchased a used ThinkPad T430[^fn1] from ebay. However, when I tried to open the Windows Defender, I saw the following pop-up:

![Never say die popup]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/WindowsDefenderPopUp.png "Windows Defender Pop-up")

Apparently, this happens if you unistall a third-party Anti-virus software. But it is easy to fix it by following steps

1. Open Powershell with elevated (Admin) access

2. Run following command


{% highlight powershell %}
Add-AppxPackage -Register -DisableDevelopmentMode “C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_cw5n1h2txyewy\AppXManifest.xml”
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Done!
