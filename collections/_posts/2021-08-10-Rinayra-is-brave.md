Rinayra got hurt today. She and I were playing when she fell and hit her head on the edge of the coffee table. It was bleeding. There was a cut, about half an inch long. We took her to the CommunityMed Urgent Care. The nurse  told that it will need stitches. But the doctor came and said, she will put skin glue. Rinayra was so brave today. She consoled her mom and had a great discussion with the doctor while she was being taken care of. Can't believe she is just 4. She is such a strong girl with a loving and caring heart!
