description: Year 2020 and 2021 have been mixed; but have they really been bad? They have propelled me toward spirituality, which I think is a good thing.

I am not sure how to rate 2020 as a year for me personally. It was a mixed bag but was the best in terms of my physical health. It was the best year health wise. I had never been that healthier before. 

However, mentally, it was traumatic. First in college, I had to skip two semesters continuously. Covid was excruciating as well. 

There is one important thing that I have learned. I now know what family actually means. Probably, still can’t explain it to others but deep within I know. 

Coming back to my mental health, now, if we discount this above incident, I think my mental health has been great as well. I learned how to meditate, thanks to Dr. Dhanada Kulkarni, who taught me Yoga and Meditation. I am much more spiritual than I ever was and love this aspect of life. Also, being spiritual helps me deal with the other mental issues I have. Sadhguru said that we can control how we feel and react. So, that is what I am doing. No one else can make me feel bad about myself. It is all me - all within me. If I decide that no one can make me feel bad or good, I can control the emotions that I want to feel. And this is the power that I want to enjoy forever.
