description: If we are all souls impersonating as man or woman, we have no sex. We are just a pure soul, an image of God. Leave people and their sex lives alone. Voyeurism is bad!

"In sleep, you do not know whether you are a man or a woman. Just as a man, impersonating a woman, does not become one, so the soul, impersonating both man and woman, has no sex. The soul is the pure, changeless image of God."

   ~ Sri Yukteswar Giri

How true is this? If we understand that the soul has no sex and no gender, then accepting and giving queer community it's due should not be a problem. If we are all souls impersonating as man or woman, we have no sex. We are just a pure soul, an image of God. 

Sex and sexuality are two things that have been very difficult for me to understand. But having read these words of Sri Yukteswar Giri and recently listening to Sadhguru, I have been presented with a slight clarity. Humans have sex for two reasons - reproduction and pleasure. Sexuality as we talk today is concerned about pleasure. If we keep reproduction aside, what ones does with their body to have pleasure is no one else's business as long as one is not causing any harm to themselves. Sex doesn't cause any harm, so no one should bother another human on how they should live with their body. 

There is no need to discuss. Leave people and their sex lives alone. Voyeurism is bad!
