Dubious nature of Gun Laws in United States is killing me. When you have permitless carry law, how can you ensure the guns are in the right hands? It is easier to purchase guns then get medical attention in United States. Cowards hide behind Second (2nd) Amendment. The Preface to the US Constitution talks about bringing tranquility to the nation. Gun Laws in many state just go against the Constitution.
