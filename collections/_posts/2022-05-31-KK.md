KK is no more. It is hard to believe. In school and then college, the trio of KK, Sonu Nigam and Shaan kept us sane. I still remember Siddharth Verma crooning Tadap Tadap ke every time he was ragged and asked to sing. It is a funny thing that your memories are tied to something that is not truly yours but the fact is that art once created belongs to everyone that can appreciate it. KK made it easy to appreciate his art. 

I still remember movie Rockford because of KK’s song. I never watched the movie but the song Yaaron Dosti is how I identify it. 

Dola Re Dola, it was Kavita Krishnamurthy and Shreya Ghoshal’s song but KK made his presence felt with just few stanzas he lent his voice to. 

There are numerous songs - Tu Hi meri Shab hai from Gangster, Aankhon mein Teri from Om Shanti Om, and my all time favorite Aashayein from Iqbal. The last one was a song that made me sail through the time when I had no job after graduation. 

There has always been a debate whether KK is better or Sonu Nigam and honestly I never cared. Both are awesome. I am a huge Sonu Nigam fan and I like to sing his songs but KK’s songs are the ones with which I feel connected. 

I just can’t believe KK is no more. With his demise, a huge part of my growing up days has been taken away. 

        हम रहें या ना रहें कल,
        कल याद आएँगे यह पल,
        पल यह हैं प्यार के पल,
        चल आ मेरे संग चल।
        
        आने वाली सुबह जाने होगी कितनी सुहानी,
        चमकेंगे ऐसे के सारी दुनिया 
        होगी अपनी दीवानी।
        
        
True, this world will forever remain mesmerized by you and your songs KK. 
Om Shanti!
