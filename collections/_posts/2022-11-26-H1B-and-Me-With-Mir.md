I have been in United States of America for a while now and even though I am a legal resident, chances of me getting an employment-based Green Card (GC) are very slim. 

I share the sentiment behind the following couplets from Mir Taqi Mir:

        चला अकबराबाद से जिस घड़ी
        दर-ओ-बाम पर चस्म-ए-हसरत पड़ी
  
Like Mir, who left Agra (Akbarabad in the couplet above) to find employment, I too left Agra in search of a job - first to Delhi, then Mysore, Pune and finally Dallas. It was difficult. My parents still live in Agra and leaving Agra was leaving a big part of my heart behind. Had to harden whatever was left to be able to live and like Mir said

        की तर्क-ए-वतन पहले क्यूँ कर करूँ
        मगर हर कदम दिल को पत्थर करूँ
    
And this all happened for what - a job to live a life. 

        ज़माने नें रखा मुझे  मुत्तसिल
        परागन्द रोज़ी, परागन्द दिल
            
The above couplet is so right, that though I found the job, my life is still scattered and it is life that is keeping me busy. 

        गयी कब परेशानी–ए-रोज़गार
        रहा मैं तो हम ताले-ए-जुल्फ-ए-यार
        
        
And the above couplet explains my issues with H1B and GC much better than I will be ever able to explain.
