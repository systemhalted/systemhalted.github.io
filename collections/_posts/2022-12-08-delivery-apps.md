The problem with delivery apps like Grubhub, DoorDash, Instacart, etc. is :

1. Marked up price
2. Service Fee
3. Delivery Fee
4. Tips

Adding 2, 3 and 4, the cost is almost equal to 1. Means you are paying double.
I am not sure why the onus of providing a reasonable living to the delivery driver is on the customer through tips when the customer is already paying Delivery Fee and Service Fee. ï¿¼

I know it is a controversial topic to touch in USA but that is mind boggling that a company has its entire revenue model where it can push the onus of their "employee" paychecks on the end customer in addition to charging the cost of providing the service to the customer.

Basically, they are screwing both the customer and their "employees".
