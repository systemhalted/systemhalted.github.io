## Introduction
Real-time payment systems have emerged as an essential pillar of the digital era, reshaping the financial landscape and providing individuals and businesses with efficient, seamless, and secure transaction capabilities. This comprehensive technical article delves into the evolution and functioning of real-time payment systems, focusing on two prominent examples - the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)[^1][^2] in India and the FedNow[^3] standard in the United States. Moreover, we will explore similar systems in other countries, such as the Faster Payments Service (FPS)[^4] in the UK, SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst)[^5] in the Eurozone, and PIX[^6] in Brazil. By examining the intricate technical aspects, architecture, and global impact of these real-time payment solutions, this article aims to shed light on their pivotal role in revolutionizing global financial transactions.

### 1. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India
#### 1.1 Genesis and Evolution
The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was a pioneering initiative launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. Its genesis can be traced back to the Indian government's vision of promoting a cashless economy and enhancing financial inclusion. Prior to UPI, digital payment systems in India were fragmented and lacked interoperability. UPI aimed to address these challenges by providing a seamless, real-time, and interbank payment solution.

The evolution of UPI has been remarkable. It started with a handful of banks and has now grown to include almost all major banks in the country. Its rapid adoption can be attributed to the convenience it offers to users, allowing them to link multiple bank accounts and perform transactions using a single mobile application.

#### 1.2 Architecture and Key Components
The architecture of UPI is designed to be simple, scalable, and secure. At its core lies the NPCI's payment switch, which acts as a central hub for routing transactions between participating banks. When a user initiates a UPI transaction through a mobile app, the payment switch ensures seamless communication between the user's bank and the recipient's bank.

Key components of the UPI system include the Virtual Payment Address (VPA), which acts as a unique identifier for users, eliminating the need for sharing sensitive bank details during transactions. Additionally, UPI leverages the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)[^7] infrastructure for real-time fund transfers, further enhancing its efficiency.

#### 1.3 Real-Time Transaction Processing
One of the most significant advantages of UPI is its ability to process transactions in real-time. When a user initiates a payment, it is authorized and settled instantly, reflecting the amount in the recipient's bank account within seconds. This real-time processing is instrumental in enabling quick and hassle-free payments between individuals and merchants.

The real-time transaction processing has fueled the adoption of UPI for various use cases, including bill payments, merchant transactions, peer-to-peer transfers, and online shopping. Additionally, its integration with other platforms like e-commerce apps and digital wallets has further contributed to its popularity.

#### 1.4 Security and Authentication
Given the sensitive nature of financial transactions, UPI places a strong emphasis on security. Each UPI transaction requires two-factor authentication, usually involving a combination of a unique MPIN (Mobile Personal Identification Number) and biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition).

Moreover, UPI transactions are secured using end-to-end encryption, safeguarding the confidentiality of user data during transmission. The Virtual Payment Address (VPA)[^8] acts as a shield, as users need not share their bank account details, reducing the risk of potential cyber frauds.

### 2. FedNow Standard in the United States
#### 2.1 The Vision for FedNow
The Federal Reserve's vision behind the development of the FedNow standard was to bridge the gap between existing payment systems and meet the growing demand for faster, more inclusive, and efficient payment options in the United States.

Recognizing the need for a ubiquitous real-time payment infrastructure, the Federal Reserve aims to provide businesses and consumers with instantaneous access to funds, enabling near-instantaneous transactions 24/7, including weekends and holidays.

#### 2.2 Technical Architecture and Infrastructure
The technical architecture of FedNow revolves around a secure, resilient, and high-speed payment network. The infrastructure is built to handle a massive volume of transactions securely, while adhering to industry standards and regulations.

The FedNow system operates on a central payment clearing mechanism, allowing participating banks to settle transactions instantly. The system will accommodate a wide range of payment types, including person-to-person (P2P), business-to-business (B2B), and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.

#### 2.3 Real-Time Settlement
One of the key highlights of FedNow is its ability to provide real-time settlement, ensuring that funds are made available to the recipient's account immediately after the transaction is initiated. This feature eliminates the need for delayed settlement periods, reducing risks and enhancing liquidity for businesses and individuals.

The real-time settlement capability is poised to revolutionize payment systems in the US, as it offers unprecedented speed and convenience, rivaling the efficiency of cash transactions.

#### 2.4 Advancing Financial Inclusion
FedNow's 24/7 availability is a significant step towards advancing financial inclusion in the United States. Unlike traditional payment systems, which often operate on limited schedules, FedNow will provide a level playing field for all users, irrespective of their location or economic status.

By offering real-time payment capabilities around the clock, FedNow will enable underserved communities to access financial services without barriers, empowering them with greater control over their finances.

### 3. Similar Interfaces in Other Countries
#### 3.1 Faster Payments Service (FPS) in the UK
The Faster Payments Service (FPS) in the UK is another noteworthy real-time payment system. Launched in 2008, FPS allows near-instantaneous electronic transfers between UK bank accounts. The system operates 24/7, providing users with the convenience of instant payments at any time.

FPS has played a vital role in transforming the UK's payments landscape, facilitating faster and secure transactions for individuals and businesses. It has bolstered the growth of mobile banking and digital payments, further reducing the reliance on cash-based transactions.

#### 3.2 SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) in the Eurozone
SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) was introduced in the Eurozone in 2017, enabling individuals and businesses to transfer euros instantly between participating banks. SCT Inst operates on a pan-European level, fostering cross-border transactions with speed and efficiency.

The adoption of SCT Inst has been steadily growing, promoting seamless and borderless payments within the Eurozone. It has also opened up new opportunities for businesses to serve customers in different European countries without the constraints of delayed payments.

#### 3.3 PIX in Brazil
PIX, launched in Brazil in 2020, is a game-changer in the country's payment landscape. This real-time payment system operates 24/7, allowing individuals and businesses to make instant transfers, payments, and purchases.
