Happy New Year.

The calendar flipped, the confetti fell, and somewhere a server kept running without caring about our rituals. Respect. Uptime is the real stoicism.

I like New Year because it is the one socially acceptable time to refactor your life in public. No tickets. No sprint planning. Just a quiet reboot and a little audacity.

## The year as a compiler

A year is a ruthless compiler. It does not care about intent. It only cares about what actually ran.

You can mean well for months and still ship nothing but good feelings. You can also ship one small thing a week and look back stunned at the pile of proof you accidentally created.

So my 2026 goal is not grandiosity. It is evidence.

Not a dramatic reinvention. A steady sequence of small, honest commits.

## What I am optimizing for

I do not want a year that looks impressive from a distance and feels hollow up close.

I want a year that feels calm in the body, clear in the mind, and useful in the world.

A year where my work is sturdy, my learning is intentional, my writing is alive, and my attention is not donated to infinite scroll like a confused philanthropist.

A year with fewer open loops and more finished sentences.

## Building, without worshipping the build

As engineers we have a strange tendency to worship motion. Activity feels like virtue. Busy is a costume that passes as importance.

This year I want more stillness around the work. Less frantic switching. More deep time. More time spent on the part where the idea becomes real.

Because real is the only feature that users can actually use.

And yes, that includes the user who is reading this right now and thinking, I should probably finally do the thing. Please do the thing. Your future self is already grateful and slightly smug.

## A tiny promise to myself

I will protect my attention like it is production data.

I will read on purpose. I will learn with a map. I will write even when the mood is missing, because craft is what remains after motivation leaves the room. 

I will treat health like a prerequisite, not a nice to have.

I will be ambitious, but not brittle.

I will aim for progress that survives a bad day.

I will finally bring Consumption Backlog in Action. What the heck! I will even create an iOS app for it. 

## The cosmic perspective, because the universe insists

Somewhere above us, photons that left their stars before humans invented arithmetic are still arriving like late emails. The sky is always delivering messages from the past.

That thought makes my problems feel smaller, and my responsibilities feel cleaner.

If the universe can be that old and still be that bright, surely I can be tired and still be kind. Surely I can be uncertain and still begin.

## Closing tab

If you are reading this, I hope 2026 brings you three things.

Something to learn that changes how you see the world.

Someone to love who makes the days lighter.

Something to build that makes you proud, quietly, when nobody is watching.

Happy New Year.

Now go ship something small.
